Dear Editor,

We hereby submit tha manuscript, “Artificial light at night (ALAN) influences understory plant traits through ecological processes: a two-year experiment in a rubber plantation in China” (Cong Zhou, Akihiro Nakamura, Xiaoyang Song, Masatoshi Katabuchi), for consideration as a brief communication article in Plant ecology.

What are the questions addressed or hypotheses tested?
We evaluated whether and how ALAN would affect the LMA (leaf mass per area) of understory plants through a two-year field light experiment in a tropical rubber plant forest in south China.

What is the major contribution of your paper to your discipline? 

Assessing the impacts of artificial light at night on understory plants has little attention. 
We evaluated whether ALAN would affect LMA (leaf mass per area) of understory plants through a two-year field light experiment in a tropical rubber plantation in South China.
We hypothesized that ALAN could impact the understory in two ways: by directly supplementing light to aboveground plant parts and indirectly by attracting insects, which could alter soil nutrient composition underground.
We selected two species: *Colocasia gigantea*, representing shade-tolerant speceis and *Melastoma candidum*, representing light-demanding species.
We found a negative relationship between LMA and the effects of ALAN.
Our study suggests that ALAN might have complex and species-specific impacts on the understory ecosystem.

How is this contribution of interest to a broad audience. 

Artificial light at night (ALAN), a leading contributor to light pollution, has been showed one unavoidable ecological factor.
Our study focuses on the effect of ALAN on understory ecosystem, and thus it targets many of plant ecologists and environmental conservation managers.

The programming code and the data supporting the findings of this study will be deposited at https://github.com/congz007/light_project.

Sincerely,

Cong Zhou, Akihiro Nakamura, Xiaoyang Song, Masatoshi Katabuchi
