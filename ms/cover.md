Dear Editor,

We hereby submit our manuscript, "Artificial light at night (ALAN) influences understory plant traits through ecological processes: a two-year experiment in a rubber plantation in China", for consideration as a brief communication article in Plant Ecology.

Artificial light at night (ALAN), a leading contributor to light pollution, is one unavoidable ecological factor.
Yet, assessing the impacts of ALAN on understory plants has little attention.
Our unique field LED experiment unveils the species-specific impacts of ALAN on leaf mass per area (LMA) of understory plants.
Specifically, our research suggests that ALAN indirectly influences LMA by enhancing soil nutrient availability rather than acting as a direct light source.

Our research provides a fresh perspective on how ALAN, an increasingly prevalent anthropogenic factor, influences forest ecosystems, particularly understory plant traits.
The complexities suggested by this study could have substantial implications for developing comprehensive forest management strategies, which we believe would be of significant interest to broad readers.

This work has not previously been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.
A preprint is available at https://doi.org/xxxx.
Codes are available at https://github.com/congz007/light_project.

Sincerely,

Masatoshi Katabuchi
