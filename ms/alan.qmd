# ABSTRACT

Artificial light at night (ALAN) demonstrated a new ecological factor that influences organisms through multi-approach.
As yet, assessing the impacts of artificial light at night on understory plants has little attention.
We evaluated whether ALAN would affect the LMA (leaf mass per area) of understory plants through a two-year field light experiment in a tropical rubber plant forest in south China.
We hypothesized that ALAN could impact the understory in two ways: by directly supplementing light to aboveground plant parts and indirectly by attracting insects, which could alter soil nutrient composition underground.
We selected two species: *Colocasia gigantea*, representing shade species and *Melastoma candidum*, representing sun species.
We measured canopy openness, LMA, soil nutrients and individual distance away from ALAN.
We found a negative relationship between LMA and the effects of ALAN.
This relationship was significant for *Colocasia gigantea* but not for*Melastoma candidum*.
These results suggest that ALAN might have complex and multifaceted impacts on the understory ecosystem.

# INTRODUCTION

Artificial light at night (ALAN), a leading contributor to light pollution, has disrupted ecological processes since the early 20th century [@Longcore2004; @Gaston2013; @Bennie2016].
A recent study estimated that around 23% of the world's inhabited land surfaces, accounting for over 80% of the global population, are subject to the adverse effects of light pollution [@Falchi2016].
Although the intensity of ALAN varies several orders of magnitude from faint skyglow reflected from distant cities to direct illumination of urban and suburban vegetation [@Bennie2016], ALAN could influence the behaviour or physiology of broad ranges of taxonomic groups, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, and plants.
It could alter ecosystem functions [@ Rich2006].
For example, ALAN attracts insects interfering in movement, foraging, reproduction, and development, as an important bringer to driving insect population decline [@Owens2020; @Boyes2021].
Many studies have focused on how ALAN changes the behaviour of animals [@Russart2018]. However, only a handful of studies have been published on the effect of ALAN on plants [@Bennie2016; @Speisser2021a; @Liu2022].
@Speisser2021a conducted plant growth experiments with and without weak ALAN (28 lx: within the range of light intensities at ground level under street lights) and showed that ALAN increases the biomass of herbaceous plants.
Their results suggest that even weak ALAN acts as a light resource for plant growth.
However, few studies have examined the effects of ALAN on plant functional traits in conditions close to their natural environment.

ALAN might, directly and indirectly, affect plant leaf functional traits.
First, ALAN might directly affect plant leaf functional traits because ALAN could work as a light resource.
Although LMA is driven by inherent genetic mechanisms [@Asner2011], environmental stresses (temperature, water and light) also shape LMA.
Plants can sense light through photoreceptors, allowing them to respond to four parameters of their light environment: light spectral quality, light intensity, light direction, and light duration [@Rich2006; @Paik2019].
@Terashima2006 showed that the light-saturated rate of leaf photosynthesis per unit area ($P_{max}$) is highly correlated with leaf structural parameters such as leaf thickness, leaf mass per area, mesophyll surface area($S_{mes}$), and chloroplast surface area ($S_c$), and sun leaves are thicker than shade leaves as the height of the palisade tissue in sun leaves is greater than that in shade leaves.
For individual species, LMA was proportional with species distributions along the insolation gradient and was significantly higher in evergreen versus deciduous species [@Ackerly2002; @Niinemets2004; @Onoda2008].
Moreover, among a local community, @Ackerly2002 demonstrated that the average values of LMA significantly increased with increasing potential diurnal insolation (PDI).

On the other hand, ALAN might indirectly affect plant leaf functional traits because ALAN has the potential to change soil environmental conditions by attracting insects.
Many insects orient themselves by maintaining a constant angle to light rays and are attracted by light [positive phototaxis? yes [@Baker1978; @Sotthibandhu1979]].
Previous studies showed that 30–40% of insects die soon after approaching street lamps for collision, overheating, dehydration, or predation [@Minnaar2015; @Owens2018].
Since nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the nutrients most frequently limiting primary productivity in forest ecosystems [@Wright2019], dead insects killed by ALAN could be important nutrient input for soil nutrients [@Behie2013].
Soil resources, especially N and P availability, are known to affect leaf mass per area (LAM) and leaf N and P contents [@Wright2004; @Riva2016], and those effects are known to be opposite to the effects of light [@Ackerly2002; @Hernandez-Vargas2019] (i.e., while strong light increases LMA but high levels of N availability decrease LMA).

Here, we investigated the relationship between LMA values of the understory and the effects of ALAN through a two-year experiment in a tropical rubber plant forest in south China.
We selected two species as subjects of this experiment, each representing sun and shade species, to discern differences in their responses to ALAN.
Our hypothesis proposes that ALAN would influence the understory via two distinct pathways: one directly, as a supplementary light source for the aboveground portions of plants, and the other indirectly, improving soil nutrient availability for the belowground parts.
Based on our hypothesis, we anticipate two key outcomes:
(a) an increase in the influence of ALAN would correspond with a decrease in the LMA value of the understory, and
(b) the extent of canopy openness and its interaction with ALAN would have a minor impact on the results of this experiment.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

*Experimental setup*

ALAN field experiments were located within the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG), China, in a rubber tree forest (N21°54' E101°16') where we set 5 plots and selected two plots for this experiment after field investigation.
LED lights (10w) were used to create an artificial light environment in all plots at night (Fig. 1).
The LED system included six components.
A metal box with an opening served as a rainproof protector.
This box was attached to a tree around 1.2m from the ground.
A rechargeable lithium battery (12v/30Ah) and an electric timer controlled the timing and duration of the LED operation at night.
An electric wire connected the battery and LED, hanging from a tree branch with a lampshade approximately 2 m from the ground.
The LED system was programmed to function automatically from 8 pm to 5 am daily.
The experiment was set up in November 2019, and leaf disc samples were collected two years later, in November 2021.

*Species Selection*

Considering the understory conditions (mature individuals and distribution of individuals) and species specificity (it should be evergreen species and not be the nitrogen fix plants like *Leguminosae*) of each plot, finally two species respectively in two plots were chosen for our study, *Colocasia gigantea (Blume) Hook. f.* representing shade species and *Melastoma candidum D. Don* for sun species.

*Measurements*

We measured the horizontal distance and geographic orientation of each individual away from the LED using a tape measure representing the relative effects of ALAN.
The canopy openness of each individual was on behalf of individual daylight interception, which was photographed by Nikon COOLPIX4500 with a fish-eye lens (Nikon FC-e8) and then measured using R package *LeafArea* [@Katabuchi2015].
For leaf mass per area (LMA), we used leaf disc (10mm^2) punched from leaf avoiding vein and leaf margin instead of whole-leaf to calculate individual mean LMA value [@Maenpuen2022].
We chose five healthy leaves, then five leaf discs, each leaf on species *Melastoma candidum D. Don*, and round five leaves, then seven leaf discs on species *Colocasia gigantea (Blume) Hook. f.*.

For soil nutrients (N, C, P), we collected surface soil samples (0-10 cm depths) in five plots in June 2019 and June 2022.
We took three replicates at the place under ALAN and 10m away from ALAN separately from each plot.
After sampling, the soils were air-dried at room temperature for one week, then sieved through 0.85mm and 0.15mm mesh finally used for total N, C measurements by combustion using an elemental analyzer (Vario MAX CN, Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH (Germany)) and total P measurement by inductively coupled plasma atomic-emission spectrometer (iCAP7400, Thermo Fisher Scientific U.S.A).
Then we calculated the relative percentage change of each nutrient between the value in 2019 and 2022 to compare the soil nutrient change with ALAN's effect (sampled under ALAN) and without ALAN's effect (sampled 10m away from ALAN).

*Data Analysis*

To analyze the effects of ALAN, daylight's effect, and their interaction on both *Melastoma candidum D. Don* and *Colocasia gigantea (Blume) Hook. f.*, we fitted a Bayesian linear mixed-effets model for each species implemented in Stan [@Carpenter2017].
The Stan code used to fit the models is available from Github at https://github.com/Congon/light_project.
Leaf mass per area (LMA) of each leaf of each individual was the response variable.
Distance from the ALAN of each individual was transformed by log and reciprocal because the accumulation of insects and the intensity of ALAN fade away from distance nonlinearly.
We conducted individual as a random effect for each species on our model because individuals of the same species were non-independent.
All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.2 [@RCoreTeam2022].

# RESULTS

The effects of ALAN and daylight were significant for species *Colocasia gigantea (Blume) Hook. f.*, while species *Melastoma candidum D. Don* showed no significance.
Artificial light at night drove the averaged individual LMA value decrease for species *Colocasia gigantea (Blume) Hook. f.* (Table 1, slope: -0.1043 [95% CI: -0.1458, -0.0621]), and for species *Melastoma candidum D. Don* (Table 1, slope: -0.0422) although not significant.
Both species showed no significance on the interaction of the effects of ALAN and daylight (Table 1).
Loss of soil nutrients ($X_{2022}/X_{2019} < 1,\ (X = C,N,P)$) were observed in general among five plots from 2019 to 2022.
The relative percentage change of each soil nutrient showed clear difference between the place under ALAN ($C_{2022}/C_{2019} = 0.919$, $N_{2022}/N_{2019} = 0.948$, $P_{2022}/P_{2019} = 0.537$) and the place 10m away from ALAN ($C_{2022}/C_{2019} = 0.663$, $N_{2022}/N_{2019} = 0.695$, $P_{2022}/P_{2019} = 0.492$) at the plot where *Colocasia gigantea (Blume) Hook. f.* disturbed, while showed not too much difference for the other species.

# DISCUSSION

Although it had been demonstrated that LMA increase with insolation [@Ackerly2002; @Niinemets2004], our research showed the effects of night artificial light to plants should be considered as a comprehensive situation.
Artificial light at night would exert an influence on the physiological processes of understory by multi-approach both aboveground and undergound.
For aboveground part, artificial light at night change the light environments of plants including light duration, light intensity and light spectral quality.
For underground part, artificial light at night might indirectly change soil nutrients conditions by attracting insects especially as an important nitrogen supplementary.
In this study, the LMA value of understory showed a negative relationship with the composite effects of artificial light at night, thereinto the relationship between LMA and soil nutrients was consistent with previous studies.
Nevertheless we could not confirm the difference in the soil nutrients was due to artificial light at night, for soil nutrents were lost througthout rubber plant forest because of precipitation, terrain and rubber tapping although artificial light at night to some extent retarded the loss of soil nutrients in our experiment place.
Furthermore the results of understory response could vary according to the species specificity (sun species showed no significance in our study) and artificial light resource (varying intensities of artificial light could cause different results [@Bennie2016]).

There was research showed that plants' biomass would increase under artificial light through controlling experiment [@Speisser2021a], but our study showed the allocation of the changing part of biomass could be channelled into mixed results.
Controlling experiment probably tend to underestimate the species interaction and unpredictable environmental heterogeneity caused by natural and artificial factors, because many irreplaceable features of field conditions, such as subtle nutrients change, herbivores and competitors are usually absent.
Thus, adequate tests of the influence of artificial light at night on understory will entail more experimental work under field conditions.
In future work, diverse artificial light resource in light spectral quality and light intensity and more understory group will be needed to simulate comprehensive effcts of artificial light from plant physiology to plant community.
In conclusion, the general pattern how understory species responds to artificial light at night remains unknown.
Our study showed the LMA value of some understory species would decrease with artificial light at night.
This negative effect could indicate that increments of artificial light at night might bring about a physiological suppression to those understory plants with which applied implications for environmental management and urban ecological planning.
