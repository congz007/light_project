# ABSTRACT

Artificial light at night (ALAN) demonstrated a new ecological factor that influences organisms through multi-approach.
As yet, assessing the impacts of artificial light at night on understory plants has little attention.
We evaluated whether ALAN would affect the LMA (leaf mass per area) of understory plants through a two-year field light experiment in a tropical rubber plantation in south China.
We hypothesized that ALAN could impact the understory in two ways: by directly supplementing light to aboveground plant parts and indirectly by attracting insects, which could alter soil nutrient composition underground.
We selected two species: *Colocasia gigantea*, representing shade species and *Melastoma candidum*, representing sun species.
We measured canopy openness, LMA, soil nutrients and individual distance away from ALAN.
We found a negative relationship between LMA and the effects of ALAN.
This relationship was significant for *Colocasia gigantea* but not for *Melastoma candidum*.
These results suggest that ALAN might have complex and multifaceted impacts on the understory ecosystem.

# INTRODUCTION

Artificial light at night (ALAN), a leading contributor to light pollution, has disrupted ecological processes since the early 20th century [@Longcore2004; @Gaston2013; @Bennie2016].
A recent study estimated that around 23% of the world's inhabited land surfaces, accounting for over 80% of the global population, are subject to the adverse effects of light pollution [@Falchi2016].
Although the intensity of ALAN varies several orders of magnitude from faint skyglow reflected from distant cities to direct illumination of urban and suburban vegetation [@Bennie2016], ALAN could influence the behaviour or physiology of broad ranges of taxonomic groups, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, and plants.
It could alter ecosystem functions [@Rich2006].
For example, ALAN attracts insects interfering in movement, foraging, reproduction, and development, as an important bringer to driving insect population decline [@Owens2020; @Boyes2021].
Many studies have focused on how ALAN changes the behaviour of animals [@Russart2018]. However, only a handful of studies have been published on the effect of ALAN on plants [@Bennie2016; @Speisser2021a; @Liu2022].
@Speisser2021a conducted plant growth experiments with and without weak ALAN (28 lx: within the range of light intensities at ground level under street lights) and showed that ALAN increases the biomass of herbaceous plants.
Their results suggest that even weak ALAN acts as a light resource for plant growth.
However, few studies have examined the effects of ALAN on plant functional traits in conditions close to their natural environment.

ALAN might, directly and indirectly, affect plant leaf functional traits.
First, ALAN might directly affect plant leaf functional traits because ALAN could work as a light resource.
Although LMA is driven by inherent genetic mechanisms [@Asner2011], environmental stresses (temperature, water and light) also shape LMA.
Plants can sense light through photoreceptors, allowing them to respond to four parameters of their light environment: light spectral quality, light intensity, light direction, and light duration [@Rich2006; @Paik2019].
@Terashima2006 showed that the light-saturated rate of leaf photosynthesis per unit area is highly correlated with leaf structural parameters such as leaf thickness, leaf mass per area, mesophyll surface area, and chloroplast surface area, and sun leaves are thicker than shade leaves as the height of the palisade tissue in sun leaves is greater than that in shade leaves.
For individual species, LMA was proportional with species distributions along the insolation gradient and was significantly higher in evergreen versus deciduous species [@Ackerly2002; @Niinemets2004; @Onoda2008].
Moreover, among a local community, @Ackerly2002 demonstrated that the average values of LMA significantly increased with increasing potential diurnal insolation (PDI).

On the other hand, ALAN might indirectly affect plant leaf functional traits because ALAN has the potential to change soil fertility by attracting insects.
Many insects orient themselves by maintaining a constant angle to light rays and are attracted by light [@Baker1978; @Sotthibandhu1979].
Previous studies showed that 30–40% of insects die soon after approaching street lamps for collision, overheating, dehydration, or predation [@Minnaar2015; @Owens2018].
Since nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the nutrients most frequently limiting primary productivity in forest ecosystems [@Wright2019], dead insects killed by ALAN could be important nutrient input for soil nutrients [@Behie2013].
Soil resources, especially N and P availability, are known to affect leaf mass per area (LAM) and leaf N and P contents [@Wright2004; @Riva2016], and those effects are known to be opposite to the effects of light [@Ackerly2002; @Hernandez-Vargas2019] (i.e., while strong light increases LMA but high levels of N availability decrease LMA).

Here, we investigated the relationship between LMA values of the understory and the effects of ALAN through a two-year experiment in a tropical rubber plant forest in south China.
We selected two species as subjects of this experiment, each representing sun and shade species, to discern differences in their responses to ALAN.
Our hypothesis proposes that ALAN would influence the understory via two distinct pathways: one directly, as a supplementary light source for the aboveground portions of plants, and the other indirectly, improving soil nutrient availability for the belowground parts.
Based on our hypothesis, we anticipate two key outcomes:
(a) an increase in the influence of ALAN would correspond with a decrease in the LMA value of the understory, and
(b) the extent of canopy openness and its interaction with ALAN would have a minor impact on the results of this experiment.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

*Experimental setup*

ALAN field experiments were located within the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG), China, in a rubber tree forest (N21°54' E101°16') where we set 5 plots and selected two plots for this experiment after field investigation.
In the study area, the average yearly temperature is recorded at 21.7 °C, accompanied by an average annual precipitation of 1557 mm.
No fertilizer was used in the study area.
LED lights (10w) were used to create an artificial light environment in all plots at night @fig-alan.
The LED system included six components.
A metal box with an opening served as a rainproof protector.
This box was attached to a tree around 1.2m from the ground.
A rechargeable lithium battery (12v/30Ah) and an electric timer controlled the timing and duration of the LED operation at night.
An electric wire connected the battery and LED, hanging from a tree branch with a lampshade approximately 2 m from the ground.
The LED system was programmed to function automatically from 8 pm to 5 am daily.
The experiment was set up in November 2019, and leaf disc samples were collected two years later, in November 2021.

*Species Selection*

Considering the understory conditions (number of mature individuals and distribution of individuals) and species specificity (it should be evergreen species and not be the nitrogen fix plants like *Leguminosae*) of each plot, finally two species respectively in two plots were chosen for our study, *Colocasia gigantea* representing shade species and *Melastoma candidum* for sun species.

*Measurements*

We measured the horizontal distance and geographic orientation of each individual away from the LED using a tape measure representing the relative effects of ALAN.
The canopy openness of each individual was on behalf of individual daylight interception, which was photographed by Nikon COOLPIX4500 with a fish-eye lens (Nikon FC-e8) and then measured using R package *LeafArea* [@Katabuchi2015].
For leaf mass per area (LMA), we used leaf disc (10mm^2) punched from leaf avoiding vein and leaf margin instead of whole-leaf to calculate individual mean LMA value [@Maenpuen2022].
We chose five healthy leaves, then five leaf discs, each leaf on species *M. candidum*, and round five leaves, then seven leaf discs on species *C. gigantea*.

For soil nutrients (N, C, P), we collected surface soil samples (0-10 cm depths) in five plots in June 2019 and June 2022.
We took three replicates at the place under ALAN and 10m away from ALAN separately from each plot.
After sampling, the soils were air-dried at room temperature for one week, then sieved through 0.85mm and 0.15mm mesh finally used for total N, C measurements by combustion using an elemental analyzer (Vario MAX CN, Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Germany) and total P measurement by inductively coupled plasma atomic-emission spectrometer (iCAP7400, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
Then we calculated the relative percentage change of each nutrient between the value in 2019 and 2022 to compare the soil nutrient change with ALAN's effect (sampled under ALAN) and without ALAN's effect (sampled 10m away from ALAN).

*Data Analysis*

To analyze the effects of ALAN, daylight's effect, and their interaction on *M. candidum* and *C. gigantea*, we fitted a Bayesian linear mixed-effects model for each species.
The leaf mass per area (LMA) of each leaf of each individual was modelled as a function of the distance from the ALAN source for each individual, the canopy openness of each individual, and the interaction between the distance from the ALAN source and the canopy openness.
We transformed the distance from the ALAN source for each individual using a log and reciprocal function, as both the accumulation of insects and the intensity of ALAN diminish non-linearly with distance.
Hereafter, we refer to the distance from the ALAN source for each individual as the ALAN effect and the canopy openness of each individual as the daylight effect.
To account for non-independence among individuals of the same species, we included individuals as a random intercept in our models.

Posterior distributions of all parameters were estimated using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm (HMC) implemented in Stan [@Carpenter2017] using the weakly-informative priors [@Gelman2008].
Convergence of the posterior distribution was assessed with the Gelman-Rubin statistic with a convergence threshold of 1.1 [@Gelman2013] and effective sample sizes > 400 [@Vehtari2021] for all parameters.
All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.x [@RCoreTeam2022] using the R package *targets* version 1.2.0 for workflow management [@Landau2023].

# RESULTS

The influence of artificial light at night (ALAN) and daylight on LMA had significant effects on the species *Colocasia gigantea *, while for *Melastoma candidum*, these effects were not significant @fig-LMA.
In the case of *C. gigantea*, ALAN led to a decrease in the average individual leaf mass per area (LMA) value (Table 1, slope: -0.1052 [95% CI: -0.15, -0.0613]).
Although *M. candidum* showed a similar decrease in LMA value in response to ALAN (Table 1, slope: -0.0434), this change was not statistically significant.
The interaction of the effects of ALAN and daylight did not yield any significant results for both species (Table 1).

General observations from 2019 to 2022 revealed a loss of soil nutrients [X~2022~/X~2019~ < 1, where X represents carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P)] across all five plots.
The relative percentage change in each soil nutrient demonstrated clear differences between locations under ALAN (C~2022~/C~2019~ = 0.919, N~2022~/N~2019~ = 0.948, P~2022~/P~2019~ = 0.537) and locations 10m away from ALAN (C~2022~/C~2019~ = 0.663, N~2022~/N~2019~ = 0.695, P~2022~/P~2019~ = 0.492) within the plot where *C. gigantea* was found.
However, these differences were less pronounced in the plot containing *M. candidum*, where under ALAN (C~2022~/C~2019~ = 0.677, N~2022~/N~2019~ = 0.761, P~2022~/P~2019~ = 0.729) and locations 10m away from ALAN (C~2022~/C~2019~ = 0.712, N~2022~/N~2019~ = 0.746, P~2022~/P~2019~ = 0.742).

# DISCUSSION

Our findings support the hypothesis that artificial light at night (ALAN) can influence leaf mass per area (LMA) values in understory plants but the response appears to vary among species.
We observed a significant decrease in LMA in response to ALAN in shade species *Colocasia gigantea*, but not in sun species *Melastoma candidum*.

We observed the apparent decline in soil nutrient content from 2019 to 2022.
This trend could be primarily attributed to the nutrient absorption characteristics of the rubber trees dominating our study location [@Yang2004].
Rubber trees are known for their high nutrient uptake, which can lead to significant soil nutrient depletion over time.
This effect was evident in our study, with noticeable decreases in soil nutrient levels over two years in both ALAN-influenced and non-influenced areas.
This soil nutrient decline seemed less pronounced near ALAN in the plot populated by *C. gigantea*.
This trend suggests a potential positive impact of ALAN on soil nutrient content, likely mediated by the attraction of insects.
ALAN is known to attract insects, which, upon death due to collision, overheating, or predation, could contribute additional nutrient inputs into the soil, such as N and P [@Minnaar2015; @Owens2018].
This ALAN-induced insect influx could help offset the nutrient depletion caused by the nutrient-intensive rubber trees, thereby helping maintain soil nutrient levels under ALAN exposure.

The significant decrease in LMA for *C. gigantea* under ALAN could be predominantly driven by indirect effects mediated through changes in soil nutrient availability rather than direct effects of ALAN acting as a light resource because sunlight increased LMA (Table 1).
The presence of ALAN is known to attract a higher density of insects, many of which may die due to collision, overheating, dehydration, or predation [@Minnaar2015; @Owens2018].
The decomposition of these deceased insects could lead to considerable enrichment of soil nutrients, particularly N and P [@Schulze1997; @Fagan2002; @Woods2004; @Behie2013], which are fundamental to plant growth.
Although the precise quantity of dead insects and the resultant increase in soil nutrient content is a subject for further detailed study, this enhanced nutrient availability could potentially shift the resource allocation strategy of *C. gigantea*.
Additionally, increased soil nutrient availability, particularly N, could increase the photosynthetic capacity of *C. gigantea*.
The enhanced nutrient availability may enable *C. gigantea* to allocate more resources to rapid leaf growth rather than structural tissue, leading to a decrease in LMA [@Onoda2017; @Hernandez-Vargas2019].

On the other hand, no significant variation in LMA was discovered in *M. candidum* when exposed to ALAN.
The exact LMA values within a species not only depend on local environmental conditions but also the phenotypic plasticity [@Fajardo2016].
Previous study showed there were significant sun-shade differences in leaf mass per area (LMA) [@Martin2020] and LMA usually varies more among species than within species [@Poorter2009a; @Osnas2018].
The limited variation within the sun species *M. candidum* in leaf mass per area (LMA) could be a possible explanation for the result.
This result also parallelled with the infrequent variability in soil conditions within the plot, which is situated on a slope with relatively high canopy openness.
Previous studies showed that the intensity of rainfall, gradient of the slope, and length of the slope can affect water erosion and the loss of nutrients such as N and P in surface runoff [@Zhao2013; @Yi2018; @Bai2020].
Thus, the soil within this plot might suffer a more substantial loss of nutrients in surface runoff in comparison to the other plot.

ALAN, an increasingly prevalent aspect of our anthropogenic world, can have complex and nuanced impacts on forest ecosystems.
Although it had been demonstrated that LMA increases with insolation [@Ackerly2002; @Niinemets2004], our research showed the effects of ALAN on plants should be considered as a comprehensive situation.
By affecting understory plant functional traits and possibly soil nutrient dynamics, ALAN may unexpectedly impact forest health and productivity.
Controlled experiments potentially tend to underestimate the species interaction and unpredictable environmental heterogeneity caused by natural and artificial factors because many irreplaceable features of field conditions, such as subtle nutrient change, herbivores, and competitors, are usually absent.
Thus, adequate tests of the influence of artificial light at night on the understory will require more experimental work under field conditions.
Further investigations into the intricate relationships between ALAN, plant functional traits, and soil nutrient dynamics are warranted to enable the development of comprehensive forest management strategies that consider the broad implications of artificial lighting.
