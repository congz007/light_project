  abstract = {In forest gaps, the geometry of canopy openings above a plant determines the spatial distribution of diffuse and direct radiation, which may be received from different sectors of the sky. We examined crown orientation and light interception by seedlings of four species of pioneer trees, Cecropia obtusifolia, Heliocarpus appendiculatus, Piper auritum, and Trema micrantha, transplanted into natural forest gaps at the Los Tuxtlas Tropical Biology Station, Veracruz, Mexico. The four species differed in the number and mean size of leaves, but total leaf area was not significantly different among equal age plants. The mean azimuth and zenith angle of diffuse and direct radiation were determined from hemispherical photographs taken above each plant. Mean diffuse radiation vectors were distributed around the zenith, with a significant clustering in an easterly direction, while mean direct radiation vectors were distributed along the solar track in the southern portion of the sky. The mean orientation of the crown of each seedling was determined from detailed, three\textemdash dimensional reconstruction of leaf display using a canopy architecture model. A directional correlation test indicated that seedling crowns were orientation of individual leaves. The mechanisms of this differential response to diffuse vs. direct radiation are not known. For diffuse radiation, the total light capture capacity integrated over all sky directions increased with seedling leaf area, while efficiency of capture per unit area decreased. Based on simulations, the light interception efficiency of each plant in its own microsite was 5\textemdash 25\% greater than would be achieved in the sites of conspecifics of in symmetric canopy openings centered on the zenith. These analyses provide a quantitative estimate of the value of nonrandom leaf and crown orientation for whole\textemdash plant light interception in natural environments.},

We collected top-of-canopy leaf samples from 2873 individuals in 57 sites spread across the Neotropics, Australasia, and Caribbean and Pacific Islands to quantify environmental and taxonomic drivers of LMA variation, and to advance remote-sensing measures of LMA. We uncovered strong taxonomic organization of LMA, with species accounting for 70\% of the global variance and up to 62\% of the variation within a forest stand. Climate, growth habit, and site conditions are secondary contributors (1\textendash 23\%) to the observed LMA patterns. Intraspecific variation in LMA averages 16\%, which is a fraction of the variation observed between species. We then used spectroscopic remote sensing (400\textendash 2500 nm) to estimate LMA with an absolute uncertainty of 14\textendash 15 g/m2 (r2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.85), or ;10\% of the global mean. With radiative transfer modeling, we demonstrated the scalability of spectroscopic remote sensing of LMA to the canopy level. Our study indicates that remotely sensed patterns of LMA will be driven by taxonomic variation against a backdrop of environmental controls expressed at site and regional levels.},

  abstract = {LIGHT TRAPS of various forms have been used to collect and study moths for well over 100 yr, but surprisingly little is known about how they attract moths. There has been some evaluation of the factors influencing the size of light trap catches1-5 and of the mechanics of the terminal phase of the moth's approach to a light6, but virtually nothing is understood about the light-trap response itself. Such an understanding is perhaps unnecessary when light traps are used solely to collect specimens, but becomes crucial as soon as they are used for quantitative sampling or survey work7. Of particular importance to the interpretation of such work is a knowledge of the distance from which moths orientate with respect to a light source; it seems intuitively that this distance should be fairly large. We present here the results of three experiments designed to determine the distance of response of free-flying moths to an artificial light source. Our results support Sotthibandhu's claim4 that the effective range of a 125 W mercury vapour (MV) lamp is about 3 m. They also lead to speculation concerning the behavioural meaning of the light trap response in moths.},

  abstract = {Many insects feed on a low-nitrogen diet, and the origin of their nitrogen supply is poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that some insects rely on nitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) to supplement their diets. Nitrogen fixation by diazotrophs has been extensively studied and convincingly demonstrated in termites, while evidence for the occurrence and role of nitrogen fixation in the diet of other insects is less conclusive. Here, we summarize the methods to detect nitrogen fixation in insects and review the available evidence for its occurrence (focusing on insects other than termites). We distinguish between three aspects of nitrogen fixation investigations: (i) detecting the presence of potential diazotrophs; (ii) detecting the activity of the nitrogen-fixing enzyme; and (iii) detecting the assimilation of fixed nitrogen into the insect tissues. We show that although evidence from investigations of the first aspect reveals ample opportunities for interactions with potential diazotrophs in a variety of insects, demonstrations of actual biological nitrogen fixation and the assimilation of fixed nitrogen are restricted to very few insect groups, including wood-feeding beetles, fruit flies, leafcutter ants, and a wood wasp. We then discuss potential implications for the insect's fitness and for the ecosystem as a whole. We suggest that combining these multiple approaches is crucial for the study of nitrogen fixation in insects, and argue that further demonstrations are desperately needed in order to determine the relative importance of diazotrophs for insect diet and fitness, as well as to evaluate their overall impact on the ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Many plants have evolved adaptations in order to survive in low nitrogen environments. One of the best-known adaptations is that of plant symbiosis with  nitrogen-fixing bacteria; this is the major route by which nitrogen is incorporated into plant biomass. A portion of this plant-associated nitrogen is then lost to insects through herbivory, and insects represent a nitrogen reservoir that is generally overlooked in nitrogen cycles. In this review we show three specialized plant adaptations that allow for the recovery of insect nitrogen; that is, plants gaining nitrogen from insects. First, we show specialized adaptations by carnivorous plants in low nitrogen habitats. Insect carnivorous plants such as pitcher plants and sundews (Nepenthaceae/Sarraceniaceae and Drosera respectively) are able to obtain substantial amounts of nitrogen from the insects that they capture. Secondly, numerous plants form associations with mycorrhizal fungi that can provide soluble nitrogen from the soil, some of which may be insect-derived nitrogen, obtained from decaying insects or insect frass. Finally, a specialized group of endophytic, insect-pathogenic fungi (EIPF) provide host plants with insect-derived nitrogen. These soil-inhabiting fungi form a remarkable symbiosis with certain plant species. They can infect a wide range of insect hosts and also form endophytic associations in which they transfer insect-derived nitrogen to the plant. Root colonizing fungi are found in disparate fungal phylogenetic lineages, indicating possible convergent evolutionary strategies between taxa, evolution potentially driven by access to carbon-containing root exudates.},

  abstract = {Plants use light as a source of both energy and information. Plant physiological responses to light, and interactions between plants and animals (such as herbivory and pollination), have evolved under a more or less stable regime of 24-h cycles of light and darkness, and, outside of the tropics, seasonal variation in day length. The rapid spread of outdoor electric lighting across the globe over the past century has caused an unprecedented disruption to these natural light cycles. Artificial light is widespread in the environment, varying in intensity by several orders of magnitude from faint skyglow reflected from distant cities to direct illumination of urban and suburban vegetation. In many cases, artificial light in the night-time environment is sufficiently bright to induce a physiological response in plants, affecting their phenology, growth form and resource allocation. The physiology, behaviour and ecology of herbivores and pollinators are also likely to be impacted by artificial light. Thus, understanding the ecological consequences of artificial light at night is critical to determine the full impact of human activity on ecosystems. Synthesis. Understanding the impacts of artificial night-time light on wild plants and natural vegetation requires linking the knowledge gained from over a century of experimental research on the impacts of light on plants in the laboratory and glasshouse with knowledge of the intensity, spatial distribution, spectral composition and timing of light in the night-time environment. To understand fully the extent of these impacts requires conceptual models that can (i) characterize the highly heterogeneous nature of the night-time light environment at a scale relevant to plant physiology; and (ii) scale physiological responses to predict impacts at the level of the whole plant, population, community and ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Globally, many ecosystems are exposed to artificial light at night. Nighttime lighting has direct biological impacts on species at all trophic levels. However, the effects of artificial light on biotic interactions remain, for the most part, to be determined. We exposed experimental mesocosms containing combinations of grassland plants and invertebrate herbivores and predators to illumination at night over a 3-year period to simulate conditions under different common forms of street lighting. We demonstrate both top-down (predation-controlled) and bottom-up (resource-controlled) impacts of artificial light at night in grassland communities. The impacts on invertebrate herbivore abundance were wavelength-dependent and mediated via other trophic levels. White LED lighting decreased the abundance of a generalist herbivore mollusc by 55\% in the presence of a visual predator, but not in its absence, while monochromatic amber light (with a peak wavelength similar to low-pressure sodium lighting) decreased abundance of a specialist herbivore aphid (by 17\%) by reducing the cover and flower abundance of its main food plant in the system. Artificial white light also significantly increased the food plant's foliar carbon to nitrogen ratio. We conclude that exposure to artificial light at night can trigger ecological effects spanning trophic levels, and that the nature of such impacts depends on the wavelengths emitted by the lighting technology employed. Policy implications. Our results confirm that artificial light at night, at illuminance levels similar to roadside vegetation, can have population effects mediated by both top-down and bottom-up effects on ecosystems. Given the increasing ubiquity of light pollution at night, these impacts may be widespread in the environment. These results underline the importance of minimizing ecosystem disruption by reducing light pollution in natural and seminatural ecosystems.},

A separate experiment in habitats with no history of lighting revealed that ALAN disrupted the feeding behavior of nocturnal caterpillars. Negative impacts were more pronounced under white light-emitting diode (LED) street lights compared to conventional yellow sodium lamps. This indicates that ALAN and the ongoing shift toward white LEDs (i.e., narrow- to broad-spectrum lighting) will have substantial consequences for insect populations and ecosystem processes.},

Moths are species-rich, sensitive to ALAN, and have undergone declines in Europe, making them the ideal group for investigating the impacts of light pollution on nocturnal insects more broadly. Here, we take a life cycle approach to review the impacts of ALAN on moths, drawing on a range of disciplines including ecology, physiology, and applied entomology. We find evidence of diverse impacts across most life stages and key behaviours. Many studies have examined flight-to-light behaviour in adults and our meta-analysis found that mercury vapour, metal halide, and compact fluorescent bulbs induce this more than LED and sodium lamps. However, we found that ALAN can also disrupt reproduction, larval development, and pupal diapause, with likely negative impacts on individual fitness, and that moths can be indirectly affected via hostplants and predators. These findings indicate that ALAN could also affect day-flying insects through impacts on earlier life stages. Overall, we found strong evidence for effects of artificial light on moth behaviour and physiology, but little rigorous, direct evidence that this scales up to impacts on populations. Crucially, there is a need to determine the potential contribution of ALAN to insect declines, relative to other drivers of change. In the meantime, we recommend precautionary strategies to mitigate possible negative effects of ALAN on insect populations.},

Controlling for the surveyor effort, the local economic infrastructure, and spatial spillovers, we find that nighttime light significantly reduces the number of sea turtle nests. According to data on replacement costs for sea turtles raised in captivity, our result suggests that the increase in lighting over the last two decades has resulted in the loss of close to 1800 sea turtles in the Caribbean, worth up to \$288 million. Incorporating our empirical estimates into a stage-structured population model, we discover that the dynamic effect of nighttime light on future generations of sea turtles is likely to be much larger, with a cost of approximately \$2.8 billion for Guadeloupe alone. More generally, our study provides a new approach to valuing the cost of environmental pollution associated with species extinction.},

A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

  abstract = {Community assembly processes are thought to shape the mean, spread, and spacing of functional trait values within communities. Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient. We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions. We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils. We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.},

  abstract = {Structural and physiological characteristics and foliar nutrient content of 14 tree species were evaluated at two sites, one being seasonally wet with relatively fertile soils and the other being seasonally dry with relatively infertile soils. Differences in environmental stress between these sites drove the resulting differences in structural and physiological characteristics and leaf nutrient content of the investigated tree species. At the wet site, trees were more productive as site conditions allowed for greater photosynthetic activity to occur. The growth of pioneer tree species such as Spondias mombin, Guazuma ulmifolia, and Luehea seemanni, correlated strongly with high water-use efficiency and large, low-density leaves. Tree species, especially N-fixing species such as Albizia adinocephala, Albizia guachapele, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Gliricidia sepium, adapted to the greater levels of environmental stress at the dry site with infertile soils by increasing their water-use efficiency. Species differences were also significant, indicating that certain species adapted physiologically and structurally to environmental stress. Tree productivity operated under different structural and physiological constraints at each site. Leaf mass area (LMA), foliar N, and leaf area index (LAI) best predicted massbased net photosynthetic capacity at the more fertile, wet site while foliar N was the best predictor of mass-based net photosynthetic capacity at the less fertile, dry site. Results from this study suggest the use of pioneer species at wet, fertile sites and N-fixing species at dry, infertile sites for restoration projects.},

To overcome this, we present the world atlas of artificial sky luminance, computed with our light pollution propagation software using new high-resolution satellite data and new precision sky brightness measurements. This atlas shows that more than 80\% of the world and more than 99\% of the U.S. and European populations live under light-polluted skies. The Milky Way is hidden from more than one-third of humanity, including 60\% of Europeans and nearly 80\% of North Americans.

It has always been assumed that the fiber in insects represents chitin based on the structural similarity between cellulose and chitin and the fact that the ADF fraction from insects contains nitrogen. In this study, a number of insect species that are raised commercially as food for insectivores were analyzed for moisture, crude protein (nitrogen \texttimes{} 6.25), fat, ash, NDF, ADF, and amino acids. Additionally, the ADF fraction was analyzed for nitrogen and amino acids to determine if proteins might be present in the ADF fraction. The ADF fraction contained a significant amount of amino acids accounting for 9.3\textendash 32.7\% of the ADF (by weight). The presence of amino acids in the ADF fraction means that using ADF to estimate insect chitin results in an overestimation of insect chitin content. Using ADF adjusted for its amino acid content, the estimated chitin content of these insect species ranged from 2.7\textendash 49.8 mg/kg (as is) and 11.6\textendash 137.2 mg/kg (dry matter basis). Additionally, these data suggest that for the species measured here the amount of chitin nitrogen is quite small (as a \% of total nitrogen) and that crude protein (nitrogen \texttimes{} 6.25) provides a reasonable estimate of the true protein for most species of insects.

The acid detergent fiber was analyzed for amino acids to estimate chitin content. Nutrient content varied widely between the four insect species. Ranges for the macronutrients were as follows: moisture (60.2\textendash 74.8\%), crude protein (15.5\textendash 19.7\%), crude fat (1.9\%\textendash 29.4\%), acid detergent fiber (1.4\textendash 3.0\%), neutral detergent fiber (2.6\textendash 3.8\%), and ash (0.8\textendash 3.5\%). Energy content ranged from a low of 918 kcal/kg for house flies to 2,977 kcal/kg for tebo worms. The chitin content of these four species ranged from 6.7 to 21.0 mg/kg. The nutrients most likely to be deficient when these species of insects are used as food for insectivores are vitamin A, vitamin D, calcium, vitamin E, thiamine, iodine, and vitamin B12. The number of nutrients deficient vs. the NRC requirements for rats on an energy basis by insect species was as follows: soldier fly larvae (3), tebo worms (15), Turkestan cockroach nymphs (5), and adult house flies (6). These data are valuable in helping assess the nutrient intake of captive insectivores and in developing gut-loading diets to improve the nutrient intake of captive insectivores.

ALAN can have a suite of effects on community structure and is a driver of evolutionary processes that influences a range of behavioral and physiological traits. Our understanding of possible effects of ALAN across species amphibians is lacking and research is warranted as ALAN could contribute to stress and declines of amphibian populations, particularly in urban areas. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to constant light or pulsed ALAN would physiologically stress Rio Grande leopard frog (Rana berlandieri) and Gulf Coast toad (Bufo valliceps) tadpoles. We reared tadpoles under constant or pulsed (on and off again) ALAN for 14 days and measured corticosterone release rates over time using a non-invasive water-borne hormone protocol. ALAN treatments did not affect behavior or growth. Tadpoles of both species had higher corticosterone (cort) release rates after 14 days of constant light exposure. Leopard frog tadpoles had lower cort release rates after exposure to pulsed ALAN while toad tadpoles had higher cort release rates. These results suggest that short-term exposure to constant or pulsed light at night may contribute to stress in tadpoles but that each species differentially modulated their cort response to ALAN exposure and a subsequent stressor. This flexibility in the upregulation and downregulation of hypothalamicpituitary-interrenal axis response may indicate an alternative mechanism for diminishing the deleterious effects of chronic stress. Nonetheless, ALAN should be considered in management and conservation plans for amphibians.},

  abstract = {The light-dependent generation of active oxygen species is termed photooxidative stress. This can occur in two ways: (1) the donation of energy or electrons directly to oxygen as a result of photosynthetic activity; (2) exposure of tissues to ultraviolet irradiation. The light-dependent destruction of catalase compounds the problem. Although generally detrimental to metabolism, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide may serve useful functions if rigorously controlled and compartmentalised. During photosynthesis the formation of active oxygen species is minimised by a number of complex and refined regulatory mechanisms. When produced, active oxygen species are eliminated rapidly by efficient antioxidative systems. The chloroplast is able to use the production and destruction of hydrogen peroxide to regulate the thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy. This is an intrinsic feature of the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport. Photoinhibition and photooxidation only usually occur when plants are exposed to stress. Active oxygen species are part of the alarm-signalling processes in plants. These serve to modify metabolism and gene expression so that the plant can respond to adverse environmental conditions, invading organisms and ultraviolet irradiation. The capacity of the antioxidative defense system is often increased at such times but if the response is not sufficient, radical production will exceed scavenging and ultimately lead to the disruption of metabolism. Oxidative damage arises in high light principally when the latter is in synergy with additional stress factors such as chilling temperatures or pollution. Environmental stress can modify the photooxidative processes in various ways ranging from direct involvement in light-induced free radical formation to the inhibition of metabolism that renders previously optimal light levels excessive. It is in just such situations that the capacity for the production of active oxygen species can exceed that for scavenging by the antioxidative defense systems. The advent of plant transformation, however, may have placed within our grasp the possibility of engineering greater stress tolerance in plants by enhancement of the antioxidative defence system.},

  abstract = {The ecological impacts of nighttime light pollution have been a longstanding source of concern, accentuated by realized and projected growth in electrical lighting. As human communities and lighting technologies develop, artificial light increasingly modifies natural light regimes by encroaching on dark refuges in space, in time, and across wavelengths. A wide variety of ecological implications of artificial light have been identified. However, the primary research to date is largely focused on the disruptive influence of nighttime light on higher vertebrates, and while comprehensive reviews have been compiled along taxonomic lines and within specific research domains, the subject is in need of synthesis within a common mechanistic framework. Here we propose such a framework that focuses on the cross-factoring of the ways in which artificial lighting alters natural light regimes (spatially, temporally, and spectrally), and the ways in which light influences biological systems, particularly the distinction between light as a resource and light as an information source. We review the evidence for each of the combinations of this cross-factoring. As artificial lighting alters natural patterns of light in space, time and across wavelengths, natural patterns of resource use and information flows may be disrupted, with downstream effects to the structure and function of ecosystems. This review highlights: (i) the potential influence of nighttime lighting at all levels of biological organisation (from cell to ecosystem); (ii) the significant impact that even low levels of nighttime light pollution can have; and (iii) the existence of major research gaps, particularly in terms of the impacts of light at population and ecosystem levels, identification of intensity thresholds, and the spatial extent of impacts in the vicinity of artificial lights.},

The flashing activity of different firefly species, especially Photinus sp1 (82\% of all occurrences), was investigated during 3 years, before and after the installation of multi metal vapor spotlights. Quantitative and qualitative analysis, performed in transects at different distances from the artificial light sources, showed significant negative effects on Photinus sp1 occurrence.

  abstract = {Recognizing soil properties associated with the plant strategy in relation to use and acquisition of resources during early secondary succession (ESS) is an important issue in plant ecology. We analyzed the relationship between 10 leaf functional traits (LFTs) and 17 soil properties including soil nutrients, transformation flows and pH along a plant chronosequence spanning first 40 years of ESS in a tropical mountain cloud forest. To recognize the multivariate variation of soil properties, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. The first axis of PCA was mainly associated with soil pH, P, Ca, Mg, K, C:N and N transformation flow, and this first axis was tightly associated with vegetation ages. The community weighted mean of the LFTs was also associated with vegetation ages. In particular, leaf P declined while leaf density, C, C:P and N:P increased with vegetation ages. Our analyses suggest associations between soil properties (the first axis of the PCA) and the LFTs (leaf area, leaf thickness, leaf density, leaf C, leaf C:P and leaf N:P) over the plant chronosequence. A fast acquisition strategy was observed in the younger sites and a resource conservation strategy in the older sites. Our results highlight the possible importance of changes in soil properties along secondary succession on plant functional traits in tropical cloud forest.},

  abstract = {1. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are essential nutrients for photosynthetic carbon assimilation and most frequently limit primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. Efficient use of those nutrients is important for plants growing in nutrient-poor environments. 2. We investigated the pattern of photosynthetic phosphorus-use efficiency (PPUE) in comparison with photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) along gradients of P and N availability across biomes with 340 tree and shrub species. We used both total soil N and P concentration and foliar N/P ratios for indicating nutrient-availability gradients. 3. Photosynthetic phosphorus-use efficiency increased with greater leaf mass per area (LMA) toward decreasing P availability. By contrast, PNUE decreased with greater LMA towards decreasing N and P availability. 4. The increase in PPUE with decreasing P availability was caused by the net effects of a relatively greater reduction in foliar P concentration and a relatively constant photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate. The decrease in PNUE with decreasing N availability was caused by the effects of a reduction in photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate with greater LMA. 5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that higher PPUE may be an effective leaf-level adaptation to P-poor soils, especially in tropical tree species. Future research should focus on the difference between PPUE and PNUE in relation to leaf economics, physiology and strategy.},

Chenopodium album (a sun species) and Alocasia macrorrhiza (a shade species) plants were grown under various photon flux densities (PFDs) to investigate whether nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components was optimized under any light conditions. The amounts of several photosynthetic components of the leaves were determined to examine nitrogen partitioning. 2. For the same PFD, nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components was similar in both species, except for leaves of C. album grown at 5\% PFD, which showed a markedly smaller fraction of nitrogen in photosystem I. 3. Optimal nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components was estimated for various PFDs using a simulation model of leaf photosynthesis. At any PFD, the actual nitrogen partitioning was very similar to the estimated optimal partitioning. However, partitioning in C. album grown at 5\% PFD deviated from the optimum. 4. For both species grown under any light conditions, estimated daily photosynthesis of actual leaves was very close to that of leaves with optimal partitioning. It is concluded that both species achieve nitrogen partitioning leading to nearly maximum carbon gain under any light condition.},

The temperatures of the male part peaked twice: (1) between 0625 and 0640 (during the female phase) and (2) 24~h later (during the male phase). The average maximum temperature was 42.25~{$\pm~$}0.14\textdegree C during the female phase (16.63\textdegree C above the ambient temperature) and 35.14~{$\pm~$}0.22\textdegree C during the male phase (10.61\textdegree C above the ambient temperature). In the lower zone of the sterile region, thermogenesis was documented only during the female phase.

  abstract = {Abstract             The consumption of poultry meat and eggs is expected to increase considerably in the nearest future, which creates the demand for new poultry feed ingredients in order to support sustainable intensive production. Moreover, the constant improvement of the genetic potential of poultry has resulted in an increased nutrient density in poultry feeds, which limits the possibility to include low quality feed ingredients. Therefore, the feed industry needs new sources of highly digestible protein with a desirable amino acid composition to substitute other valuable but limited protein sources of animal origin, such as fishmeal. With estimated 1.5 to 3 million species, the class of insects harbours the largest species variety in the world including species providing a high protein and sulphur amino acids content, which can be successfully exploited as feed for poultry. The aim of this paper is to review the present state of knowledge concerning the use of insect protein in poultry nutrition and the possibilities of mass production of insects for the feed industry. There is no doubt that insects have an enormous potential as a source of nutrients (protein) and active substances (polyunsaturated fatty acids, antimicrobial peptides) for poultry. It can be concluded, based on many experimental results, that meals from insects being members of the orders Diptera (black soldier fly, housefly), Coleoptera (mealworms) and Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locust, crickets and katylids), may be successfully used as feed material in poultry diets. However, legislation barriers in the European Union, as well as relatively high costs and limited quantity of produced insects are restrictions in the large-scale use of insect meals in poultry nutrition.},

  abstract = {Understanding the effects of disturbance by human trampling on ecosystem processes is essential for the management of recreational areas. Discussions on recreational impacts are based either on data from trampling experiments or on field survey data from sites subjected to long-term recreational use, but rarely on a combination of both. We examined whether results from a short-term trampling experiment reflect the impact of long-term trampling around frequently used fire places. We compared short- and long-term effects of human trampling on above-ground forest vegetation and soil physical, chemical and microbial characteristics. We found both similarities and differences in short- and long-term trampling effects. Both short- and long-term trampling reduced plant cover, plant height and species density, though long-term effects were more pronounced than short-term effects. In both approaches, leaf litter biomass decreased, whereas soil density increased with trampling intensity. Other soil characteristics including soil moisture, total soil organic matter content and total organic nitrogen content were not or only marginally affected by short- and long-term trampling. Furthermore, soil microbial biomass and the activity of dehydrogenase did not change in both approaches. In contrast, the activity of {$\beta$}-glucosidase was only reduced by short-term trampling, whereas activity of phosphomonoesterase was reduced only by long-term trampling. Soil compaction was one factor reducing microbial activities at low and medium trampling intensities in our experiment and in the highly compacted area around the fire rings. We conclude that it could be problematic to use the results of short-term trampling experiments to predict general long-term trampling effects. Our results imply also that the restoration of degraded sites might be hampered by the low nutrient turnover resulting from the reduced litter layer and changes in enzyme activities, mitigating a successful re-establishment and growth of plants.},

Despite evidence of sufficient light brightness inducing plant physiology and affecting phenology, generalization regarding effects of light pollution on plant phenology across species and locations is less clear. Meanwhile, the relative contributions and joint effects of artificial light pollution and climate change or other anthropic stressors still remain unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized in situ plant phenological observations of seven tree species during 1991\textendash 2015 in Europe, night-time light dataset and gridded temperature dataset to investigate the impacts of the artificial light pollution on spatial-temporal shifts of plant phenological phases under climatic warming. We found 70\% of the observation sites were exposed to increased light pollution during 1992\textendash 2015. Among them, plant phenological phases substantially delayed at 12\textendash 39\% observation sites of leaf-out, and 6\textendash 53\% of flowering. We also found plant species appeared to be more sensitive to artificial light pollution, and phenology advancement was hindered more prominently and even delay phenomenon exhibited when the color level showed stronger sky brightness. Linear mixed models indicate that although temperature plays a dominant role in shifts of plant phenological phases at the spatial scale, the inhibitory effect of artificial light pollution is evident considering the interactions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantitatively establish the relationship between artificial light pollution and plant phenology across species and locations. Meanwhile, these findings provide a new insight into the ecological responses of plant phenology to the potential but poorly understood environmental stressors under this warmer world and call for light pollution to be accorded the equal status as other global change phenomena.},

Although numerous studies have tested its potential biological and ecological impacts on animals, very few studies have tested whether it affects alien and native plants differently. Furthermore, common plant species, and particularly common alien species, are often found to benefit more from additional resources than rare native and rare alien species. Whether this is also the case with regard to increasing light due to ALAN is still unknown. Here, we tested how ALAN affected the performance of common and rare alien and native plant species in Germany directly, and indirectly via flying insects. We grew five common alien, six rare alien, five common native, and four rare native plant species under four combinations of two ALAN (no ALAN vs. ALAN) and two insect-exclusion (no exclusion vs. exclusion) treatments, and compared their biomass production. We found that common plant species, irrespective of their origin, produced significantly more biomass than rare species and that this was particularly true under ALAN. Furthermore, alien species tended to show a slightly stronger positive response to ALAN than native species did (p = .079). Our study shows that common plant species benefited more from ALAN than rare ones. This might lead to competitive exclusion of rare species, which could have cascading impacts on other trophic levels and thus have important community-wide consequences when ALAN becomes more widespread. In addition, the slightly more positive response of alien species indicates that ALAN might increase the risk of alien plant invasions.},

However, no current U.S. estimates are based on systematic analysis of multiple data sources. We reviewed the published literature and acquired unpublished datasets to systematically quantify bird\textendash building collision mortality and species-specific vulnerability. Based on 23 studies, we estimate that between 365 and 988 million birds (median {$\frac{1}{4}$} 599 million) are killed annually by building collisions in the U.S., with roughly 56\% of mortality at low-rises, 44\% at residences, and ,1\% at high-rises. Based on .92,000 fatality records, and after controlling for population abundance and range overlap with study sites, we identified several species that are disproportionately vulnerable to collisions at all building types. In addition, several species listed as national Birds of Conservation Concern due to their declining populations were identified to be highly vulnerable to building collisions, including Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera), Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris), Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum). The identification of these five migratory species with geographic ranges limited to eastern and central North America reflects seasonal and regional biases in the currently available building-collision data. Most sampling has occurred during migration and in the eastern U.S. Further research across seasons and in underrepresented regions is needed to reduce this bias. Nonetheless, we provide quantitative evidence to support the conclusion that building collisions are second only to feral and free-ranging pet cats, which are estimated to kill roughly four times as many birds each year, as the largest source of direct human-caused mortality for U.S. birds.},

The whole-leaf to leaf disc LMA ratio was higher for species with higher leaf tissue density and larger leaf, and their variance was greater for species with lower leaf tissue density and thinner leaves. Small leaf punch also inflated the ratio. The extent of ITV only weakly matched between whole-leaf and disc-based estimates (R2 = 0.08).This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Premise Leaf mass per area (LMA), which is an important functional trait in leaf economic spectrum and plant growth analysis, is measured from leaf discs or whole leaves. Differences between the measurement methods may lead to large differences in the estimates of LMA values. Methods We examined to what extent estimates of LMA based on whole leaves match those based on discs using 334 woody species from a wide range of biomes (tropics, subtropics, savanna, and temperate), whether the relationship varied by leaf morphology (tissue density, leaf area, leaf thickness), punch size (0.6- and 1.0-cm diameter), and whether the extent of intraspecifc variation for each species matches. Results Disc-based estimates of species mean LMA matched the whole-leaf estimates well, and whole-leaf LMA tended to be 9.69\% higher than leaf-disc LMA. The ratio of whole-leaf LMA to leaf-disc LMA was higher for species with higher leaf tissue density and larger leaves, and variance in the ratio was greater for species with lower leaf tissue density and thinner leaves. Estimates based on small leaf discs also inflated the ratio. The extent of the intraspecific variation only weakly matched between whole-leaf and disc-based estimates (R2 = 0.08). Conclusions Our results suggest that simple conversion between whole-leaf and leaf-disc LMA is difficult for species obtained with a small leaf punch, but it should be possible for species obtained with a large+ leaf punch. Accurately representing leaf traits will likely require careful selection between leaf-disc and whole-leaf traits depending on the objectives. Quantifying intraspecific variation using leaf discs should be also considered with caution.},

  abstract = {Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a widespread alteration of the natural environment that can affect the functioning of ecosystems. ALAN can change the movement patterns of freshwater animals that move into the adjacent riparian and terrestrial ecosystems, but the implications for local riparian consumers that rely on these subsidies are still unexplored. We conducted a 2-year field experiment to quantify changes of freshwater-terrestrial linkages by installing streetlights in a previously light-na\"ive riparian area adjacent to an agricultural drainage ditch. We compared the abundance and community composition of emerging aquatic insects, flying insects, and ground-dwelling arthropods with an unlit control site. Comparisons were made within and between years using two-way generalized least squares (GLS) model and a BACI design (Before-After Control-Impact). Aquatic insect emergence, the proportion of flying insects that were aquatic in origin, and the total abundance of flying insects all increased in the ALAN-illuminated area. The abundance of several night-active ground-dwelling predators (Pachygnatha clercki, Trochosa sp., Opiliones) increased under ALAN and their activity was extended into the day. Conversely, the abundance of nocturnal ground beetles (Carabidae) decreased under ALAN. The changes in composition of riparian predator and scavenger communities suggest that the increase in aquatic-to-terrestrial subsidy flux may cascade through the riparian food web. The work is among the first studies to experimentally manipulate ALAN using a large-scale field experiment, and provides evidence that ALAN can affect processes that link adjacent ecosystems. Given the large number of streetlights that are installed along shorelines of freshwater bodies throughout the globe, the effects could be widespread and represent an underestimated source of impairment for both aquatic and riparian systems.},

  abstract = {Artificial night lighting threatens to disrupt strongly conserved light-dependent processes in animals and may have cascading effects on ecosystems as species interactions become altered. Insectivorous bats and their prey have been involved in a nocturnal, co-evolutionary arms race for millions of years. Lights may interfere with anti-bat defensive behaviours in moths, and disrupt a complex and globally ubiquitous interaction between bats and insects, ultimately leading to detrimental consequences for ecosystems on a global scale. We combined experimental and mathematical approaches to determine effects of light pollution on a free-living bat\textendash insect community. We compared prey selection by Cape serotine bats Neoromicia capensis in naturally unlit and artificially lit conditions using a manipulative field experiment, and developed a probabilistic model based on a suite of prey-selection factors to explain differences in observed diet. Moth consumption by N. capensis was low under unlit conditions (mean percentage volume {$\pm$} SD: 5{$\cdot$}91 {$\pm$} 6{$\cdot$}25\%), while moth consumption increased sixfold (mean percentage volume {$\pm$} SD: 35{$\cdot$}42 {$\pm$} 17{$\cdot$}90\%) under lit conditions despite a decrease in relative moth abundance. Predictive prey-selection models that included high-efficacy estimates for eared-moth defensive behaviour found most support given diet data for bats in unlit conditions. Conversely, models that estimated eared-moth defensive behaviour as absent or low found more support given diet data for bats in lit conditions. Our models therefore suggest the increase in moth consumption was a result of light-induced, decreased eared-moth defensive behaviour. Policy implications. In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth-eating bats and eared moths will face ever-increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively. Lights should be developed to be less attractive to moths, with the goal of reducing effects on moth behaviour. Unfortunately, market preference for broad-spectrum lighting and possible effects on other taxa make development of moth-friendly lighting improbable. Mitigation should therefore focus on the reduction of temporal, spatial and luminance redundancy in outdoor lighting. Restriction of light inside nature reserves and urban greenbelts can help maintain dark refugia for moth-eating bats and moths, and may become important for their persistence.},

We distinguished between the age-dependent changes in net assimilation rates due to modifications in leaf dry mass per unit area (MA), foliar nitrogen content per unit dry mass (NM), and fractional partitioning of foliar nitrogen in the proteins of photosynthetic electron transport (FB), Rubisco (FR) and in light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complexes (Vcmax;A {$\propto$} MANMFR; Jmax;A {$\propto$} MANMFB). In both species, increases in Jmax;A and Vcmax;A during leaf development were primarily determined by nitrogen allocation to growing leaves, increases in leaf nitrogen partitioning in photosynthetic machinery, and increases in MA. Canopy differences in the rate of development of leaf photosynthetic capacity were mainly controlled by the rate of change in MA. There was only small within-canopy variation in the initial rate of biomass accumulation per unit Qint (slope of MA versus leaf age relationship per unit Qint), suggesting that canopy differences in the rate of development of Jmax;A and Vcmax;A are directly proportional to Qint. Nevertheless, MA, nitrogen, Jmax;A and Vcmax;A of mature leaves were not proportional to Qint because of a finite MA in leaves immediately after bud-burst (light-independent component of MA). MA, leaf chlorophyll contents and chlorophyll : N ratio of mature leaves were best correlated with the integrated average quantum flux density during leaf development, suggesting that foliar photosynthetic apparatus, once developed, is not affected by day-to-day fluctuations in Qint. However, for the upper canopy leaves of P. tremula and for the entire canopy of T. cordata, there was a continuous decline in N contents per unit dry mass in mature non-senescent leaves on the order of 15\textendash 20\% for a change of leaf age from 40 to 120 d, possibly manifesting nitrogen reallocation to bud formation. The decline in N contents led to similar decreases in leaf photosynthetic capacity and foliar chlorophyll contents. These data demonstrate that light-dependent variation in the rate of developmental changes in MA determines canopy differences in photosynthetic capacity, whereas foliar photosynthetic apparatus is essentially constant in fully developed leaves.},

  abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) dynamics in croplands need to be improved for the increase of food production in subSaharan Africa. Our objective was to investigate the crop residue management in terms of quality and application method to improve soil N dynamics during the period of crop growth in maize croplands with special reference to soil textures in dry tropical agroecosystems. Field experiments were conducted during the rainy seasons of 2012 and 2013 at clayey and sandy sites in Tanzania. Five treatment plots were established: plots with no residue applied (Ctrl plot), chemical fertilizer applied (F plot), maize residue (high C:N ratio = 60) incorporated (M-In plot) or mulched (M-On plot), and cowpea residue (low C:N ratio = 21) incorporated (P-In plot). In each plot, we regularly collected surface soil and crop samples and measured inorganic N (NO3-\textendash N and NH4+\textendash N), the soil respiration rate, and crop N uptake. Rainfall and soil moisture content were also continuously monitored. Our results showed that cowpea residue with high biodegradability caused prompt increases in the soil respiration rate and soil inorganic N because decomposition of the applied residue occurred within ca. 2 weeks after the application at both the clayey and sandy sites. It resulted in high N use efficiency in the early growing period and 18\textendash 73\% higher total crop N uptake than that in the maize residue plots at both sites. The application methods (incorporation and mulching) showed no significant difference in soil N dynamics and crop yield, although higher soil respiration was observed in the M-In plot than the M-On plot at the clayey site. However, at the sandy site, mulching of maize residue resulted in the increased soil inorganic N content in the M-On plot by 18\textendash 26\% compared with that in the M-In plot during the cropping season because of the higher soil moisture content. Consequently, crop N uptake in the mulching plot resulted in 26\textendash 59\% higher than that in the incorporation plot.},

Although broad trade-offs among leaf structural and physiological traits have been demonstrated, we still do not have a comprehensive view of the fundamental constraints underlying the LES trade-offs. Here, we investigated physiological and structural mechanisms underpinning the LES by analysing a novel data compilation incorporating rarely considered traits such as the dry mass fraction in cell walls, nitrogen allocation, mesophyll CO2 diffusion and associated anatomical traits for hundreds of species covering major growth forms. The analysis demonstrates that cell wall constituents are major components of leaf dry mass (18\textendash 70\%), especially in leaves with high leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and long lifespan. A greater fraction of leaf mass in cell walls is typically associated with a lower fraction of leaf nitrogen (N) invested in photosynthetic proteins; and lower within-leaf CO2 diffusion rates, as a result of thicker mesophyll cell walls. The costs associated with greater investments in cell walls underpin the LES: long leaf lifespans are achieved via higher LMA and in turn by higher cell wall mass fraction, but this inevitably reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis.},

Long-term records show that insect abundance has declined significantly over this time, with worrying implications for terrestrial ecosystems. The majority of investigations into the vulnerability of nocturnal insects to artificial light have focused on the flight-to-light behavior exhibited by select insect families. However, ALAN can affect insects in other ways as well. This review proposes five categories of ALAN impact on nocturnal insects, highlighting past research and identifying key knowledge gaps. We conclude with a summary of relevant literature on bioluminescent fireflies, which emphasizes the unique vulnerability of terrestrial light-based communication systems to artificial illumination. Comprehensive understanding of the ecological impacts of ALAN on diverse nocturnal insect taxa will enable researchers to seek out methods whereby fireflies, moths, and other essential members of the nocturnal ecosystem can coexist with humans on an increasingly urbanized planet.},

  abstract = {Light is a crucial environmental cue not only for photosynthetic energy production but also for plant growth and development. Plants employ sophisticated methods to detect and interpret information from incoming light. Five classes of photoreceptors have been discovered in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These photoreceptors act either distinctly and/or redundantly in fine-tuning many aspects of plant life cycle. Unlike mobile animals, sessile plants have developed an enormous plasticity to adapt and survive in changing environment. By monitoring different information arising from ambient light, plants precisely regulate downstream signaling pathways to adapt accordingly. Given that changes in the light environment is typically synchronized with other environmental cues such as temperature, abiotic stresses, and seasonal changes, it is not surprising that light signaling pathways are interconnected with multiple pathways to regulate plant physiology and development. Indeed, recent advances in plant photobiology revealed a large network of co-regulation among different photoreceptor signaling pathways as well as other internal signaling pathways (e.g., hormone signaling). In addition, some photoreceptors are directly involved in perception of non-light stimuli (e.g., temperature). Therefore, understanding highly inter-connected signaling networks is essential to explore the photoreceptor functions in plants. Here, we summarize how plants co-ordinate multiple photoreceptors and their internal signaling pathways to regulate a myriad of downstream responses at molecular and physiological levels.},

Light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (Amax), nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl) content and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) were measured in leaves of trees of different heights along a natural light gradient in a French Guiana rain forest. The following four species, arranged in order from most shade-tolerant to pioneer, were studied: Duguetia surinamensis, Vouacapoua americana, Dicorynia guianensis and Goupia glabra. Light availability of trees was estimated using hemispherical photography. 2. The pioneer species Goupia had the lowest LMA and leaf N on both an area and mass basis, whereas Duguetia had the highest values. In general, leaf variables of Vouacapoua and Dicorynia tended to be intermediates. Because Amax/area was similar among species, Goupia showed both a much higher light-saturated photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) and Amax/mass. Leaves of Vouacapoua demonstrated the greatest plasticity in Amax/area, particularly in small saplings. 3. A distinction could be made between the effect of tree height and light availability on the structural, i.e. LMA, and photosynthetic leaf characteristics of all four species. The direction and magnitude of the variation in variables were similar among species. 4. LMA was the key variable that mainly determined variation in the other leaf variables along tree height and light availability gradients, with the exception of changes in chlorophyll concentration. Amax/area, N/area, LMA and stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) increased, whereas Chl/mass decreased, with both increasing tree height and canopy openness. Amax/mass, PNUEmax and Amax/Chl increased with increasing openness only. N/mass and Chl/area were independent of tree height and openness, except for small saplings of Goupia which had a much lower Chl/area.},

  abstract = {Life has evolved to internalize and depend upon the daily and seasonal light cycles to synchronize physiology and behavior with environmental conditions. The nightscape has been vastly changed in response to the use of artificial lighting. Wildlife is now often exposed to direct lighting via streetlights or indirect lighting via sky glow at night. Because many activities rely on daily and seasonal light cues, the effects of artificial light at night could be extensive, but remain largely unknown. Laboratory studies suggest exposure to light at night can alter typical timing of daily locomotor activity and shift the timing of foraging/food intake to the daytime in nocturnal rodents. Additionally, nocturnal rodents decrease anxiety-like behaviors (i.e., spend more time in the open and increase rearing up) in response to even dim light at night. These are all likely maladaptive responses in the wild. Photoperiodic animals rely on seasonal changes in day length as a cue to evoke physiological and behavioral modifications to anticipate favorable and unfavorable conditions for survival and reproduction. Light at night can mask detection of short days, inappropriately signal long days, and thus desynchronize seasonal reproductive activities. We review laboratory and the sparse field studies that address the effects of exposure to artificial light at night to propose that exposure to light at night disrupts circadian and seasonal behavior in wildlife, which potentially decreases individual fitness and modifies ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Dionaea is a highly specialized carnivorous plant species with a unique mechanism for insect capture. The leaf is converted into an osmotically driven trap that closes when an insect triggers sensory trichomes. This study investigates the significance of insect capture for growth of Dionaea at different successional stages after a fire, under conditions where the prey is highly variable in its isotope signature. The contribution of insect-derived nitrogen (N) was estimated using the natural abundance of 15N. In contrast to previous 15N studies on carnivorous plants, the problem emerges that d15N values of prey insects ranged between \`A4.47\`u (grasshoppers) and q7.21\`u (ants), a range that exceeds the d15N values of non carnivorous reference plants (\`A4.2\`u) and soils (q3\`u). Thus, the isotope-mixing model used by Shearer and Kohl to estimate the amount of insect-derived N is not applicable. In a novel approach, the relationships of d15N values of different organs with d15N of trapping leaves were used to estimate N partitioning within the plant. It is estimated that soon after fire approximately 75\% of the nitrogen is obtained from insects, regardless of plant size or developmental stage. The estimates are verified by calculating the average isotope signatures of insects from an isotope mass balance and comparing this with the average measured d15N values of insects. It appears that for Dionaea to survive and reach the flowering stage, seedlings must first reach the 6th-leaf rosette stage, in which trap surface area nearly doubles and facilitates the capture of large insects. Large amounts of nitrogen thus made available to plants may facilitate an enhanced growth rate and the progressive production of additional large traps. Dionaea reaches a maximum abundance after fire when growth of the competing vegetation is suppressed. About 10 years after fire, when grasses and shrubs recover, Dionaea becomes overtopped by other species. This would not only reduce carbon assimilation but also the probability of catching larger prey. The amount of insect-derived nitrogen decreases to 46\%, and Dionaea becomes increasingly dependent on N-supply from the soil. Competition for both light and N may cause the near disappearance of Dionaea in older stages of the fire succession.},

The comparison of some selected physicochemical soil properties viz. texture, particle density, moisture content, pH, organic carbon and total nitrogen between planted site (Telir char) and barren site (Boyar char) has been investigated at surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-45 cm) soil across three different land strips viz. inland, middle part and sea side in Lakshmipur coast of Bangladesh. Sand particles in the soil were lower in planted site than barren site. The reverse trend was found in case of both silt and clay percentage. Coastal afforestation had a significant effect on soil binding process since a common trend of increment in soil particle density was noticed. Maximum increment (20.43\% to 23.30\%) in soil moisture content was recorded in surface soil across the seaside while at subsurface soil both across the middle part (19.53\% to 22.30\%) and sea side (20.19\% to 22.96\%). Moreover, the highest reduction in soil pH was recorded at surface soil (7.27 to 6.60) across the sea side and subsurface soil (7.16 to 6.67) in inland due to the influence of coastal plantation. Across all the land strips and the soil depths studied, soil organic carbon was higher in planted site than in barren site with only exception at subsurface soil in the middle part (0.50\% in both sites). Total soil nitrogen in the study area was increased at both depths due to forestation with the highest increment in the inland at both surface and subsurface soil.},

  abstract = {Early in the 20th century, disparate human developmental processes culminate excess artificial light during night time and distort the phenological, physiological and ecological responses, which are sustained in the plants, animals and microorganism from millions of years. Earlier studies regarding artificial light (AL) during the night predominantly covered the drastic effects on animal systems. Although, drastic effects of AL during night time are enormous; therefore, the present topic is focused on the physiological and ecological consequences of artificial night light pollution (ANLP) on plant systems. In these consequences, most of the plant processes under ANLP are affected intensely and cause compelling changes in plant life cycle from germination to maturity. However, severe effects were observed in the case of pollination, photoreceptor signalling, flowering and microhabitats of plants. Along with drastic effects on ecology and environments, its relevance to human developmental processes cannot be avoided. Therefore, we need to equipoise between sustainable environment and steadily human development processes. Further, selection of plant/crop species, which are more responsive to ANLP, can minimize the ecological consequences of night light pollution. Likewise, changing artificial nightscape with the implication of new LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) lightening policies like UJALA (www.ujala.gov.in), which are low cost, more durable, eco-friendly and less emitter of CO2, have potential to overcome the biodiversity threats, which arise due to old artificial lightening technology from decades. Hence, adopting new advance artificial lightening technology and understanding its impact on plant ecosystem will be a future challenge for plant biologist.},

However, due to urbanization, and human development activities lot of excess light generated in environment during night time and responsible for anthropogenic generated pollution (ALAN; artificial night light pollution). This pollution has cause for serious problem in plants as it affects their processes and functions which are under the control of light or diurnal cycle. Plant biorhythms mostly diurnal rhythms such as stomatal movements, photosynthetic activity, and many more metabolic processes are under the control of period of light and dark, which are crucially affected by artificial light at night. Similarly, the crucial plant processes such as pollination, flowering, and yield determining processes are controlled by the diurnal cycle and ALAN affects these processes and ultimately hampers the plant fitness and development. To keep in mind the effect of artificial light at night on plant biorhythm and eco-physiological processes, this chapter will focus on the status of global artificial night light pollution and the responsible factors. Further, we will explore the details mechanisms of plant biorhythm and eco-physiological processes under artificial light at night and how this mechanism can be a global threat. Then at the end we will focus on the ANLP reducing strategies such as new light policy, advanced lightening technology such as remote sensing and lightening utilisation optimisation.},

  abstract = {Artificial light at night has rapidly increased during the last century, and could potentially affect many ecological processes, from individuals via communities to entire ecosystems. Recent research has shown that artificial light at night may not only affect the behaviour of animals but also growth of plants and vegetation composition. However, it is not known yet whether artificial light at night may also affect other global change components such as plant invasions. Here, we tested how naturalized alien plants respond to artificial light at night, and particularly whether widely naturalized species differ from less-widely naturalized species in their response to artificial light at night. We grew nine taxonomically related pairs of widely naturalized and less-widely naturalized species alone and in competition, with native plants with and without artificial light at night. We found that in the competition treatment, artificial light at night significantly increased the total biomass production per pot, but not the biomass ratio between the naturalized alien plants and the native competitors. Interestingly, although the less-widely naturalized species produced overall significantly less biomass than the widely naturalized species, there was a trend that the less-widely naturalized species increased their biomass more strongly in response to artificial light at night than the widely naturalized species did (p = 0.07). Synthesis. Our study shows that although widely naturalized plants produce more biomass than less-widely naturalized plants across different environmental conditions, they took less advantage of artificial light at night. This suggests that artificial light at night might lead to increased spread of currently less-widely naturalized species, at least when artificial light at night continues to increase.},

  abstract = {Light pollution is the presence of unwanted, inappropriate, or excessive artificial lighting. In a descriptive sense, the term "light pollution" refers to the effects of any poorly implemented lighting, during the day or night. Light pollution can be understood not only as a phenomenon resulting from a specific source or kind of pollution, but also as a contributor to the wider, collective impact of various sources of pollution.Although this type of pollution can exist throughout the day, its effects are magnified during the night with the contrast of darkness. It has been estimated that 83 percent of the world's people live under light-polluted skies and that 23 percent of the world's land area is affected by skyglow. The area affected by artificial illumination continues to increase. A major side-effect of urbanization, light pollution is blamed for compromising health, disrupting ecosystems, and spoiling aesthetic environments. Solutions to light pollution are often easy steps like adjusting light fixtures or using more appropriate lightbulbs. However, because it is a human-made phenomenon, addressing its impacts on humans and the wider ecological systems of Earth involves vast societal complexities that overlay light pollution with political, social, and economic considerations.},

The added nutrients include nitrogen (N) in 36 experiments, phosphorus (P) in 33 experiments, calcium and potassium in one experiment each, and various mixtures of essential nutrients in the remaining experiments. I evaluate the hypotheses that nutrients limit tropical forest plants, nutrient limitation is stronger in successional than in old-growth forests, P but not N is limiting in lowland forests, and N is limiting in montane forests. Responses to the most complete nutrient mix used in each experiment were strong for plant functions that contribute to aboveground production (Hedges' g averages 0.87) and nonsignificant for fine root biomass. Responses to N addition and to P addition were strong for tissue concentrations of the added element (Hedges' g averages 0.75 and 1.4, respectively), moderate for fine litter production (0.64 and 0.65, respectively), moderate to weak for plant growth (0.46 and 0.37, respectively) and nonsignificant for fine root biomass. Growth responses were stronger in successional than in old-growth forests. All responses were unrelated to elevation. The 48 experiments included 30 factorial nitrogen-phosphorus experiments that enable additional direct tests of the widely cited hypotheses that P limitation is stronger than N limitation in lowland forests and vice versa in montane forests. Both hypotheses were rejected. The N \texttimes{} P interaction effect was nonsignificant across the factorial experiments. In conclusion, nutrients clearly limit tropical forest plants. Limitation by N is widespread in both lowland and montane forests, and the same is true for P. Single experiments identify limitation by calcium and potassium, and correlative studies suggest limitation by calcium, potassium, and magnesium. The available evidence is consistent with the possibility that most macronutrients limit tropical forest plants; however, experiments focus almost exclusively on N and P. The way forward will include taking fuller advantage of existing nutrient addition experiments, siting new experiments strategically, and developing cost-effective methods to assay responses to all of the essential nutrients soils supply to plants.},

  abstract = {Land-use changes, especially the conversion of native forest vegetation to cropland and plantations in tropical region, can alter soil C and N pools and N availability for plant uptake. Deforestation, followed by shifting cultivation and establishment of rubber tree plantation, is a common land-use change in Xishuangbanna, southwest China. However the influence of this kind of land-use change on soil C and N dynamics in this region remains poorly understood. This study was conducted to assess the effects of land-use change on soil C and N pools. Soil samples were collected on five adjacent plots, which belong to three land-use types including secondary forest-an acuminate banana (Musa itinerans) secondary forest and a male bamboo (Dendrocalamus membranaceae) secondary forest, shifting cultivation, and rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis (H. B. K.) Muell. Arg.) plantation (one plot is 3-year-old, and another is 7-year-old). We measured soil bulk density (BD), pH value, moisture content and concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TSN), and inorganic N (NO3- -N and NH4+ -N) at 0-3, 3-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm depths, and calculated C and N pools in 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, and 0-60 cm soil layers. Compared with the adjacent secondary forests, shifting cultivation and establishment of rubber tree plantations resulted in significant decline in concentrations and stocks of SOC and TSN in 0-20 and 0-60 cm soil layers, and increase in pH and bulk density at 0-3, 3-20, and 20-40 cm depths. Soil moisture content decreased only in 0-20 cm surface soils in shifting cultivation and plantations. The dynamics of mineral N was much more complex, which had different trends among depths and ecosystems. Compared with the secondary forests, SOC stocks in 0-20 cm surface soils in shifting cultivation and rubber tree plantations (3-year-old plantation and 7-year-old plantation) decreased by 34.0\%, 33\%, and 23\%; and TSN stocks decreased by 32.2\%, 20.4\%, and 20.4\%, respectively, whereas the decreases of SOC and TSN stocks in 0-60 cm soil layers were much less. The results indicated that C and N losses were mainly occurred in 0-20 cm surface soil, followed by 20-40 cm layer.},

  abstract = {Human activities disturb Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) in desert areas throughout the world. To assess the effects of trampling on biocrusts and its consequence on sandy soil quality, soil beneath trampling to early-successional cyanobacteria\textendash lichen crusts and late-successional moss crusts was served as the research object in vegetation areas of the Tengger Desert. Trampling intensity was divided into non-trampling, medium trampling and severe trampling of biocrusts. We analyzed changes in soil microbial biomass, enzyme activities and nematode communities one year after trampling biocrust. The results showed that trampling biocrusts reduced soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), lowered soil urease, invertase, catalase and dehydrogenase activity, as well as reduced soil nematode abundance, generic richness, Shannon\textendash Weaver index (H{${'}$}) and Maturity index (MI) in the study areas, and severely-trampled biocrusts caused a strong decline in these parameters (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). The declined soil available phosphorus (P), available N, total N and P may be the major factors that cause the observed reduction in soil microbial and nematode parameters. Impact was correlated with trampling intensity or successional stages of biocrusts. The studied soil microbial and nematode parameters were negatively correlated with trampling intensity. Furthermore, soil microbial biomass, the four enzyme activities, nematode abundance and generic richness were significantly greater underneath trampled/untrampled moss crusts than corresponding trampled/untrampled cyanobacteria-lichen crusts, indicating late-successional crusts have a higher tolerance to trampling disturbance compared to early-successional crusts. Overall, these results suggest that trampling biocrusts lead to a degradation of sandy soil quality in desert ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Invasive plants often change a/biotic soil conditions to increase their competitiveness. We compared the microbially mediated soil nitrogen (N) cycle of invasive Mikania micrantha and two co-occurring native competitors, Persicaria chinensis and Paederia scandens. We assessed how differences in plant tissue N content, soil nutrients, N cycling rates, microbial biomass and activity, and diversity and abundance of N-cycling microbes associated with these species impact their competitiveness. Mikania micrantha outcompeted both native species by transferring more N to plant tissue (37.9\textendash 55.8\% more than natives). We found total soil N to be at lowest, and available N highest, in M. micrantha rhizospheres, suggesting higher N cycling rates compared with both natives. Higher microbial biomass and enzyme activities in M. micrantha rhizospheres confirmed this, being positively correlated with soil N mineralization rates and available N. Mikania micrantha rhizospheres harbored highly diverse N-cycling microbes, including N-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Structural equation models indicated that M. micrantha obtained available N via AOA-mediated nitrification mainly. Field data mirrored our experimental findings. Nitrogen availability is elevated under M. micrantha invasion through enrichment of microbes that participate in N cycling, in turn increasing available N for plant growth, facilitating high interspecific competition.},

  abstract = {Due to the wide reach of media reports about scientific research and technological tools such as the world wide web (WWW), the Internet, and web browsers, citizens today have access to factual information about the negative impact of artificial light at night (ALAN) on their dark skies, and their health and well-being. This means they can now make educated decisions and take the necessary steps to help protect themselves and their communities from disruptive light pollution. Whilst this action is positive and welcomed, unfortunately, according to collected data, not all such initiatives have been successful. Although our understanding of this groundswell movement is deepening, further studies are required to complete a worldwide picture of the current situation. This paper therefore investigates the various actions taken by citizens, as well as the challenges, methods, and tools involved, regarding good practices initiated by grass roots activism on how to reduce existing and potential light pollution. The results of a comparative analysis of 262 international case studies (lawsuits and online petitions) reveal that, since the 1990s, there has been an increase in the number of legal cases related to light pollution due to the rise in public awareness, the availability of scientific knowledge via the Internet, and the ability to take accurate lighting measurements and perform lighting simulations. Also, in the last decade a new tool for digital participation in the form of online petitions has established a new movement of citizen action to mitigate the effects of light pollution. Based on this information, a seven-step framework involving recommendations for citizen action has been developed. It is expected that this new knowledge will benefit those citizens planning future efforts involving the development, implementation, and monitoring processes of outdoor lighting. Additionally, it might support the evolution of planning and policy approaches that are sustainable and necessary to improve the application and installation of ecologically/biologically responsible illumination for towns, cities, and natural habitats.},
