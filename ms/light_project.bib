  abstract = {In forest gaps, the geometry of canopy openings above a plant determines the spatial distribution of diffuse and direct radiation, which may be received from different sectors of the sky. We examined crown orientation and light interception by seedlings of four species of pioneer trees, Cecropia obtusifolia, Heliocarpus appendiculatus, Piper auritum, and Trema micrantha, transplanted into natural forest gaps at the Los Tuxtlas Tropical Biology Station, Veracruz, Mexico. The four species differed in the number and mean size of leaves, but total leaf area was not significantly different among equal age plants. The mean azimuth and zenith angle of diffuse and direct radiation were determined from hemispherical photographs taken above each plant. Mean diffuse radiation vectors were distributed around the zenith, with a significant clustering in an easterly direction, while mean direct radiation vectors were distributed along the solar track in the southern portion of the sky. The mean orientation of the crown of each seedling was determined from detailed, three\textemdash dimensional reconstruction of leaf display using a canopy architecture model. A directional correlation test indicated that seedling crowns were orientation of individual leaves. The mechanisms of this differential response to diffuse vs. direct radiation are not known. For diffuse radiation, the total light capture capacity integrated over all sky directions increased with seedling leaf area, while efficiency of capture per unit area decreased. Based on simulations, the light interception efficiency of each plant in its own microsite was 5\textemdash 25\% greater than would be achieved in the sites of conspecifics of in symmetric canopy openings centered on the zenith. These analyses provide a quantitative estimate of the value of nonrandom leaf and crown orientation for whole\textemdash plant light interception in natural environments.},

Potential incident solar radiation (insolation) was estimated from a geographic information system to quantify microclimate affinities of these species across north- and south-facing slopes. At the community level, leaf size and SLA both declined with increasing insolation, based on average trait values for the species found in plots along the gradient. However, leaf size and SLA were not significantly correlated across species, suggesting that these two traits are decoupled and associated with different aspects of performance along this environmental gradient. For individual species, SLA was negatively correlated with species distributions along the insolation gradient, and was significantly lower in evergreen versus deciduous species. Leaf size exhibited a negative but non-significant trend in relation to insolation distribution of individual species. At the community level, variance in leaf size increased with increasing insolation. For individual species, there was a greater range of leaf size on south-facing slopes, while there was an absence of small-leaved species on northfacing slopes. These results demonstrate that analyses of plant functional traits along environmental gradients based on community level averages may obscure important aspects of trait variation and distribution among the constituent species.},

There has been some evaluation of the factors influencing the size of light trap catches1-5 and of the mechanics of the terminal phase of the moth's approach to a light6, but virtually nothing is understood about the light-trap response itself. Such an understanding is perhaps unnecessary when light traps are used solely to collect specimens, but becomes crucial as soon as they are used for quantitative sampling or survey work7. Of particular importance to the interpretation of such work is a knowledge of the distance from which moths orientate with respect to a light source; it seems intuitively that this distance should be fairly large. We present here the results of three experiments designed to determine the distance of response of free-flying moths to an artificial light source. Our results support Sotthibandhu's claim4 that the effective range of a 125 W mercury vapour (MV) lamp is about 3 m. They also lead to speculation concerning the behavioural meaning of the light trap response in moths.},

Plant physiological responses to light, and interactions between plants and animals (such as herbivory and pollination), have evolved under a more or less stable regime of 24-h cycles of light and darkness, and, outside of the tropics, seasonal variation in day length. The rapid spread of outdoor electric lighting across the globe over the past century has caused an unprecedented disruption to these natural light cycles. Artificial light is widespread in the environment, varying in intensity by several orders of magnitude from faint skyglow reflected from distant cities to direct illumination of urban and suburban vegetation. In many cases, artificial light in the night-time environment is sufficiently bright to induce a physiological response in plants, affecting their phenology, growth form and resource allocation. The physiology, behaviour and ecology of herbivores and pollinators are also likely to be impacted by artificial light. Thus, understanding the ecological consequences of artificial light at night is critical to determine the full impact of human activity on ecosystems. Synthesis. Understanding the impacts of artificial night-time light on wild plants and natural vegetation requires linking the knowledge gained from over a century of experimental research on the impacts of light on plants in the laboratory and glasshouse with knowledge of the intensity, spatial distribution, spectral composition and timing of light in the night-time environment. To understand fully the extent of these impacts requires conceptual models that can (i) characterize the highly heterogeneous nature of the night-time light environment at a scale relevant to plant physiology; and (ii) scale physiological responses to predict impacts at the level of the whole plant, population, community and ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Globally, many ecosystems are exposed to artificial light at night. Nighttime lighting has direct biological impacts on species at all trophic levels. However, the effects of artificial light on biotic interactions remain, for the most part, to be determined. We exposed experimental mesocosms containing combinations of grassland plants and invertebrate herbivores and predators to illumination at night over a 3-year period to simulate conditions under different common forms of street lighting. We demonstrate both top-down (predation-controlled) and bottom-up (resource-controlled) impacts of artificial light at night in grassland communities. The impacts on invertebrate herbivore abundance were wavelength-dependent and mediated via other trophic levels. White LED lighting decreased the abundance of a generalist herbivore mollusc by 55\% in the presence of a visual predator, but not in its absence, while monochromatic amber light (with a peak wavelength similar to low-pressure sodium lighting) decreased abundance of a specialist herbivore aphid (by 17\%) by reducing the cover and flower abundance of its main food plant in the system. Artificial white light also significantly increased the food plant's foliar carbon to nitrogen ratio. We conclude that exposure to artificial light at night can trigger ecological effects spanning trophic levels, and that the nature of such impacts depends on the wavelengths emitted by the lighting technology employed. Policy implications. Our results confirm that artificial light at night, at illuminance levels similar to roadside vegetation, can have population effects mediated by both top-down and bottom-up effects on ecosystems. Given the increasing ubiquity of light pollution at night, these impacts may be widespread in the environment. These results underline the importance of minimizing ecosystem disruption by reducing light pollution in natural and seminatural ecosystems.},

Moths are species-rich, sensitive to ALAN, and have undergone declines in Europe, making them the ideal group for investigating the impacts of light pollution on nocturnal insects more broadly. Here, we take a life cycle approach to review the impacts of ALAN on moths, drawing on a range of disciplines including ecology, physiology, and applied entomology. We find evidence of diverse impacts across most life stages and key behaviours. Many studies have examined flight-to-light behaviour in adults and our meta-analysis found that mercury vapour, metal halide, and compact fluorescent bulbs induce this more than LED and sodium lamps. However, we found that ALAN can also disrupt reproduction, larval development, and pupal diapause, with likely negative impacts on individual fitness, and that moths can be indirectly affected via hostplants and predators. These findings indicate that ALAN could also affect day-flying insects through impacts on earlier life stages. Overall, we found strong evidence for effects of artificial light on moth behaviour and physiology, but little rigorous, direct evidence that this scales up to impacts on populations. Crucially, there is a need to determine the potential contribution of ALAN to insect declines, relative to other drivers of change. In the meantime, we recommend precautionary strategies to mitigate possible negative effects of ALAN on insect populations.},

To this end we assemble a panel data set of sea turtle nesting activity and satellite-derived measures of nighttime light. Controlling for the surveyor effort, the local economic infrastructure, and spatial spillovers, we find that nighttime light significantly reduces the number of sea turtle nests. According to data on replacement costs for sea turtles raised in captivity, our result suggests that the increase in lighting over the last two decades has resulted in the loss of close to 1800 sea turtles in the Caribbean, worth up to \$288 million. Incorporating our empirical estimates into a stage-structured population model, we discover that the dynamic effect of nighttime light on future generations of sea turtles is likely to be much larger, with a cost of approximately \$2.8 billion for Guadeloupe alone. More generally, our study provides a new approach to valuing the cost of environmental pollution associated with species extinction.},

  abstract = {Community assembly processes are thought to shape the mean, spread, and spacing of functional trait values within communities. Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient. We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions. We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils. We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.},

ALAN can have a suite of effects on community structure and is a driver of evolutionary processes that influences a range of behavioral and physiological traits. Our understanding of possible effects of ALAN across species amphibians is lacking and research is warranted as ALAN could contribute to stress and declines of amphibian populations, particularly in urban areas. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to constant light or pulsed ALAN would physiologically stress Rio Grande leopard frog (Rana berlandieri) and Gulf Coast toad (Bufo valliceps) tadpoles. We reared tadpoles under constant or pulsed (on and off again) ALAN for 14 days and measured corticosterone release rates over time using a non-invasive water-borne hormone protocol. ALAN treatments did not affect behavior or growth. Tadpoles of both species had higher corticosterone (cort) release rates after 14 days of constant light exposure. Leopard frog tadpoles had lower cort release rates after exposure to pulsed ALAN while toad tadpoles had higher cort release rates. These results suggest that short-term exposure to constant or pulsed light at night may contribute to stress in tadpoles but that each species differentially modulated their cort response to ALAN exposure and a subsequent stressor. This flexibility in the upregulation and downregulation of hypothalamicpituitary-interrenal axis response may indicate an alternative mechanism for diminishing the deleterious effects of chronic stress. Nonetheless, ALAN should be considered in management and conservation plans for amphibians.},

This can occur in two ways: (1) the donation of energy or electrons directly to oxygen as a result of photosynthetic activity; (2) exposure of tissues to ultraviolet irradiation. The light-dependent destruction of catalase compounds the problem. Although generally detrimental to metabolism, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide may serve useful functions if rigorously controlled and compartmentalised. During photosynthesis the formation of active oxygen species is minimised by a number of complex and refined regulatory mechanisms. When produced, active oxygen species are eliminated rapidly by efficient antioxidative systems. The chloroplast is able to use the production and destruction of hydrogen peroxide to regulate the thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy. This is an intrinsic feature of the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport. Photoinhibition and photooxidation only usually occur when plants are exposed to stress. Active oxygen species are part of the alarm-signalling processes in plants. These serve to modify metabolism and gene expression so that the plant can respond to adverse environmental conditions, invading organisms and ultraviolet irradiation. The capacity of the antioxidative defense system is often increased at such times but if the response is not sufficient, radical production will exceed scavenging and ultimately lead to the disruption of metabolism. Oxidative damage arises in high light principally when the latter is in synergy with additional stress factors such as chilling temperatures or pollution. Environmental stress can modify the photooxidative processes in various ways ranging from direct involvement in light-induced free radical formation to the inhibition of metabolism that renders previously optimal light levels excessive. It is in just such situations that the capacity for the production of active oxygen species can exceed that for scavenging by the antioxidative defense systems. The advent of plant transformation, however, may have placed within our grasp the possibility of engineering greater stress tolerance in plants by enhancement of the antioxidative defence system.},

As human communities and lighting technologies develop, artificial light increasingly modifies natural light regimes by encroaching on dark refuges in space, in time, and across wavelengths. A wide variety of ecological implications of artificial light have been identified. However, the primary research to date is largely focused on the disruptive influence of nighttime light on higher vertebrates, and while comprehensive reviews have been compiled along taxonomic lines and within specific research domains, the subject is in need of synthesis within a common mechanistic framework. Here we propose such a framework that focuses on the cross-factoring of the ways in which artificial lighting alters natural light regimes (spatially, temporally, and spectrally), and the ways in which light influences biological systems, particularly the distinction between light as a resource and light as an information source. We review the evidence for each of the combinations of this cross-factoring. As artificial lighting alters natural patterns of light in space, time and across wavelengths, natural patterns of resource use and information flows may be disrupted, with downstream effects to the structure and function of ecosystems. This review highlights: (i) the potential influence of nighttime lighting at all levels of biological organisation (from cell to ecosystem); (ii) the significant impact that even low levels of nighttime light pollution can have; and (iii) the existence of major research gaps, particularly in terms of the impacts of light at population and ecosystem levels, identification of intensity thresholds, and the spatial extent of impacts in the vicinity of artificial lights.},

Fireflies provide good models to investigate its effects on nocturnal wildlife, since they depend on their bioluminescence for reproduction. This study investigated the impact of artificial illumination on firefly activity at the new campus of the Federal University of S\&atildeo Carlos (Sorocaba, Brazil). The flashing activity of different firefly species, especially Photinus sp1 (82\% of all occurrences), was investigated during 3 years, before and after the installation of multi metal vapor spotlights. Quantitative and qualitative analysis, performed in transects at different distances from the artificial light sources, showed significant negative effects on Photinus sp1 occurrence. This study proposes fireflies as potential flagship species and bioindicators for artificial night lighting and for the first time quantifies its effects, providing subsidies for future conservationist legislations regarding photopollution.},

  abstract = {Recognizing soil properties associated with the plant strategy in relation to use and acquisition of resources during early secondary succession (ESS) is an important issue in plant ecology. We analyzed the relationship between 10 leaf functional traits (LFTs) and 17 soil properties including soil nutrients, transformation flows and pH along a plant chronosequence spanning first 40 years of ESS in a tropical mountain cloud forest. To recognize the multivariate variation of soil properties, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. The first axis of PCA was mainly associated with soil pH, P, Ca, Mg, K, C:N and N transformation flow, and this first axis was tightly associated with vegetation ages. The community weighted mean of the LFTs was also associated with vegetation ages. In particular, leaf P declined while leaf density, C, C:P and N:P increased with vegetation ages. Our analyses suggest associations between soil properties (the first axis of the PCA) and the LFTs (leaf area, leaf thickness, leaf density, leaf C, leaf C:P and leaf N:P) over the plant chronosequence. A fast acquisition strategy was observed in the younger sites and a resource conservation strategy in the older sites. Our results highlight the possible importance of changes in soil properties along secondary succession on plant functional traits in tropical cloud forest.},

Chenopodium album (a sun species) and Alocasia macrorrhiza (a shade species) plants were grown under various photon flux densities (PFDs) to investigate whether nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components was optimized under any light conditions. The amounts of several photosynthetic components of the leaves were determined to examine nitrogen partitioning. 2. For the same PFD, nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components was similar in both species, except for leaves of C. album grown at 5\% PFD, which showed a markedly smaller fraction of nitrogen in photosystem I. 3. Optimal nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components was estimated for various PFDs using a simulation model of leaf photosynthesis. At any PFD, the actual nitrogen partitioning was very similar to the estimated optimal partitioning. However, partitioning in C. album grown at 5\% PFD deviated from the optimum. 4. For both species grown under any light conditions, estimated daily photosynthesis of actual leaves was very close to that of leaves with optimal partitioning. It is concluded that both species achieve nitrogen partitioning leading to nearly maximum carbon gain under any light condition.},

Despite evidence of sufficient light brightness inducing plant physiology and affecting phenology, generalization regarding effects of light pollution on plant phenology across species and locations is less clear. Meanwhile, the relative contributions and joint effects of artificial light pollution and climate change or other anthropic stressors still remain unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized in situ plant phenological observations of seven tree species during 1991\textendash 2015 in Europe, night-time light dataset and gridded temperature dataset to investigate the impacts of the artificial light pollution on spatial-temporal shifts of plant phenological phases under climatic warming. We found 70\% of the observation sites were exposed to increased light pollution during 1992\textendash 2015. Among them, plant phenological phases substantially delayed at 12\textendash 39\% observation sites of leaf-out, and 6\textendash 53\% of flowering. We also found plant species appeared to be more sensitive to artificial light pollution, and phenology advancement was hindered more prominently and even delay phenomenon exhibited when the color level showed stronger sky brightness. Linear mixed models indicate that although temperature plays a dominant role in shifts of plant phenological phases at the spatial scale, the inhibitory effect of artificial light pollution is evident considering the interactions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantitatively establish the relationship between artificial light pollution and plant phenology across species and locations. Meanwhile, these findings provide a new insight into the ecological responses of plant phenology to the potential but poorly understood environmental stressors under this warmer world and call for light pollution to be accorded the equal status as other global change phenomena.},

However, no current U.S. estimates are based on systematic analysis of multiple data sources. We reviewed the published literature and acquired unpublished datasets to systematically quantify bird\textendash building collision mortality and species-specific vulnerability. Based on 23 studies, we estimate that between 365 and 988 million birds (median {$\frac{1}{4}$} 599 million) are killed annually by building collisions in the U.S., with roughly 56\% of mortality at low-rises, 44\% at residences, and ,1\% at high-rises. Based on .92,000 fatality records, and after controlling for population abundance and range overlap with study sites, we identified several species that are disproportionately vulnerable to collisions at all building types. In addition, several species listed as national Birds of Conservation Concern due to their declining populations were identified to be highly vulnerable to building collisions, including Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera), Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris), Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum). The identification of these five migratory species with geographic ranges limited to eastern and central North America reflects seasonal and regional biases in the currently available building-collision data. Most sampling has occurred during migration and in the eastern U.S. Further research across seasons and in underrepresented regions is needed to reduce this bias. Nonetheless, we provide quantitative evidence to support the conclusion that building collisions are second only to feral and free-ranging pet cats, which are estimated to kill roughly four times as many birds each year, as the largest source of direct human-caused mortality for U.S. birds.},

  abstract = {Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a widespread alteration of the natural environment that can affect the functioning of ecosystems. ALAN can change the movement patterns of freshwater animals that move into the adjacent riparian and terrestrial ecosystems, but the implications for local riparian consumers that rely on these subsidies are still unexplored. We conducted a 2-year field experiment to quantify changes of freshwater-terrestrial linkages by installing streetlights in a previously light-na\"ive riparian area adjacent to an agricultural drainage ditch. We compared the abundance and community composition of emerging aquatic insects, flying insects, and ground-dwelling arthropods with an unlit control site. Comparisons were made within and between years using two-way generalized least squares (GLS) model and a BACI design (Before-After Control-Impact). Aquatic insect emergence, the proportion of flying insects that were aquatic in origin, and the total abundance of flying insects all increased in the ALAN-illuminated area. The abundance of several night-active ground-dwelling predators (Pachygnatha clercki, Trochosa sp., Opiliones) increased under ALAN and their activity was extended into the day. Conversely, the abundance of nocturnal ground beetles (Carabidae) decreased under ALAN. The changes in composition of riparian predator and scavenger communities suggest that the increase in aquatic-to-terrestrial subsidy flux may cascade through the riparian food web. The work is among the first studies to experimentally manipulate ALAN using a large-scale field experiment, and provides evidence that ALAN can affect processes that link adjacent ecosystems. Given the large number of streetlights that are installed along shorelines of freshwater bodies throughout the globe, the effects could be widespread and represent an underestimated source of impairment for both aquatic and riparian systems.},

  abstract = {Artificial night lighting threatens to disrupt strongly conserved light-dependent processes in animals and may have cascading effects on ecosystems as species interactions become altered. Insectivorous bats and their prey have been involved in a nocturnal, co-evolutionary arms race for millions of years. Lights may interfere with anti-bat defensive behaviours in moths, and disrupt a complex and globally ubiquitous interaction between bats and insects, ultimately leading to detrimental consequences for ecosystems on a global scale. We combined experimental and mathematical approaches to determine effects of light pollution on a free-living bat\textendash insect community. We compared prey selection by Cape serotine bats Neoromicia capensis in naturally unlit and artificially lit conditions using a manipulative field experiment, and developed a probabilistic model based on a suite of prey-selection factors to explain differences in observed diet. Moth consumption by N. capensis was low under unlit conditions (mean percentage volume {$\pm$} SD: 5{$\cdot$}91 {$\pm$} 6{$\cdot$}25\%), while moth consumption increased sixfold (mean percentage volume {$\pm$} SD: 35{$\cdot$}42 {$\pm$} 17{$\cdot$}90\%) under lit conditions despite a decrease in relative moth abundance. Predictive prey-selection models that included high-efficacy estimates for eared-moth defensive behaviour found most support given diet data for bats in unlit conditions. Conversely, models that estimated eared-moth defensive behaviour as absent or low found more support given diet data for bats in lit conditions. Our models therefore suggest the increase in moth consumption was a result of light-induced, decreased eared-moth defensive behaviour. Policy implications. In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth-eating bats and eared moths will face ever-increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively. Lights should be developed to be less attractive to moths, with the goal of reducing effects on moth behaviour. Unfortunately, market preference for broad-spectrum lighting and possible effects on other taxa make development of moth-friendly lighting improbable. Mitigation should therefore focus on the reduction of temporal, spatial and luminance redundancy in outdoor lighting. Restriction of light inside nature reserves and urban greenbelts can help maintain dark refugia for moth-eating bats and moths, and may become important for their persistence.},

Long-term records show that insect abundance has declined significantly over this time, with worrying implications for terrestrial ecosystems. The majority of investigations into the vulnerability of nocturnal insects to artificial light have focused on the flight-to-light behavior exhibited by select insect families. However, ALAN can affect insects in other ways as well. This review proposes five categories of ALAN impact on nocturnal insects, highlighting past research and identifying key knowledge gaps. We conclude with a summary of relevant literature on bioluminescent fireflies, which emphasizes the unique vulnerability of terrestrial light-based communication systems to artificial illumination. Comprehensive understanding of the ecological impacts of ALAN on diverse nocturnal insect taxa will enable researchers to seek out methods whereby fireflies, moths, and other essential members of the nocturnal ecosystem can coexist with humans on an increasingly urbanized planet.},

  abstract = {Light is a crucial environmental cue not only for photosynthetic energy production but also for plant growth and development. Plants employ sophisticated methods to detect and interpret information from incoming light. Five classes of photoreceptors have been discovered in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These photoreceptors act either distinctly and/or redundantly in fine-tuning many aspects of plant life cycle. Unlike mobile animals, sessile plants have developed an enormous plasticity to adapt and survive in changing environment. By monitoring different information arising from ambient light, plants precisely regulate downstream signaling pathways to adapt accordingly. Given that changes in the light environment is typically synchronized with other environmental cues such as temperature, abiotic stresses, and seasonal changes, it is not surprising that light signaling pathways are interconnected with multiple pathways to regulate plant physiology and development. Indeed, recent advances in plant photobiology revealed a large network of co-regulation among different photoreceptor signaling pathways as well as other internal signaling pathways (e.g., hormone signaling). In addition, some photoreceptors are directly involved in perception of non-light stimuli (e.g., temperature). Therefore, understanding highly inter-connected signaling networks is essential to explore the photoreceptor functions in plants. Here, we summarize how plants co-ordinate multiple photoreceptors and their internal signaling pathways to regulate a myriad of downstream responses at molecular and physiological levels.},

Light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (Amax), nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl) content and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) were measured in leaves of trees of different heights along a natural light gradient in a French Guiana rain forest. The following four species, arranged in order from most shade-tolerant to pioneer, were studied: Duguetia surinamensis, Vouacapoua americana, Dicorynia guianensis and Goupia glabra. Light availability of trees was estimated using hemispherical photography. 2. The pioneer species Goupia had the lowest LMA and leaf N on both an area and mass basis, whereas Duguetia had the highest values. In general, leaf variables of Vouacapoua and Dicorynia tended to be intermediates. Because Amax/area was similar among species, Goupia showed both a much higher light-saturated photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) and Amax/mass. Leaves of Vouacapoua demonstrated the greatest plasticity in Amax/area, particularly in small saplings. 3. A distinction could be made between the effect of tree height and light availability on the structural, i.e. LMA, and photosynthetic leaf characteristics of all four species. The direction and magnitude of the variation in variables were similar among species. 4. LMA was the key variable that mainly determined variation in the other leaf variables along tree height and light availability gradients, with the exception of changes in chlorophyll concentration. Amax/area, N/area, LMA and stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) increased, whereas Chl/mass decreased, with both increasing tree height and canopy openness. Amax/mass, PNUEmax and Amax/Chl increased with increasing openness only. N/mass and Chl/area were independent of tree height and openness, except for small saplings of Goupia which had a much lower Chl/area.},

  abstract = {Early in the 20th century, disparate human developmental processes culminate excess artificial light during night time and distort the phenological, physiological and ecological responses, which are sustained in the plants, animals and microorganism from millions of years. Earlier studies regarding artificial light (AL) during the night predominantly covered the drastic effects on animal systems. Although, drastic effects of AL during night time are enormous; therefore, the present topic is focused on the physiological and ecological consequences of artificial night light pollution (ANLP) on plant systems. In these consequences, most of the plant processes under ANLP are affected intensely and cause compelling changes in plant life cycle from germination to maturity. However, severe effects were observed in the case of pollination, photoreceptor signalling, flowering and microhabitats of plants. Along with drastic effects on ecology and environments, its relevance to human developmental processes cannot be avoided. Therefore, we need to equipoise between sustainable environment and steadily human development processes. Further, selection of plant/crop species, which are more responsive to ANLP, can minimize the ecological consequences of night light pollution. Likewise, changing artificial nightscape with the implication of new LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) lightening policies like UJALA (www.ujala.gov.in), which are low cost, more durable, eco-friendly and less emitter of CO2, have potential to overcome the biodiversity threats, which arise due to old artificial lightening technology from decades. Hence, adopting new advance artificial lightening technology and understanding its impact on plant ecosystem will be a future challenge for plant biologist.},

However, due to urbanization, and human development activities lot of excess light generated in environment during night time and responsible for anthropogenic generated pollution (ALAN; artificial night light pollution). This pollution has cause for serious problem in plants as it affects their processes and functions which are under the control of light or diurnal cycle. Plant biorhythms mostly diurnal rhythms such as stomatal movements, photosynthetic activity, and many more metabolic processes are under the control of period of light and dark, which are crucially affected by artificial light at night. Similarly, the crucial plant processes such as pollination, flowering, and yield determining processes are controlled by the diurnal cycle and ALAN affects these processes and ultimately hampers the plant fitness and development. To keep in mind the effect of artificial light at night on plant biorhythm and eco-physiological processes, this chapter will focus on the status of global artificial night light pollution and the responsible factors. Further, we will explore the details mechanisms of plant biorhythm and eco-physiological processes under artificial light at night and how this mechanism can be a global threat. Then at the end we will focus on the ANLP reducing strategies such as new light policy, advanced lightening technology such as remote sensing and lightening utilisation optimisation.},

In light winds the compass orientation of tethered large yellow underwing moths, Noctua pronuba, is independent of wind direction. On moonlit nights the moon's azimuth is used as an orientation cue. On starlit nights, in the absence of the moon, stellar orientation using stars about 95 \textdegree{} from the pole star is strongly implicated. There is no compensation for the shift of these celestial cues during the night. In a dark-room or when their eyes are painted over N. pronuba are disorientated. A model of the mechanism of nocturnal moth migration is presented.},

  abstract = {Artificial light at night has rapidly increased during the last century, and could potentially affect many ecological processes, from individuals via communities to entire ecosystems. Recent research has shown that artificial light at night may not only affect the behaviour of animals but also growth of plants and vegetation composition. However, it is not known yet whether artificial light at night may also affect other global change components such as plant invasions. Here, we tested how naturalized alien plants respond to artificial light at night, and particularly whether widely naturalized species differ from less-widely naturalized species in their response to artificial light at night. We grew nine taxonomically related pairs of widely naturalized and less-widely naturalized species alone and in competition, with native plants with and without artificial light at night. We found that in the competition treatment, artificial light at night significantly increased the total biomass production per pot, but not the biomass ratio between the naturalized alien plants and the native competitors. Interestingly, although the less-widely naturalized species produced overall significantly less biomass than the widely naturalized species, there was a trend that the less-widely naturalized species increased their biomass more strongly in response to artificial light at night than the widely naturalized species did (p = 0.07). Synthesis. Our study shows that although widely naturalized plants produce more biomass than less-widely naturalized plants across different environmental conditions, they took less advantage of artificial light at night. This suggests that artificial light at night might lead to increased spread of currently less-widely naturalized species, at least when artificial light at night continues to increase.},

  abstract = {The subject of this paper, sun leaves are thicker and show higher photosynthetic rates than the shade leaves, is approached in two ways. The first seeks to answer the question: why are sun leaves thicker than shade leaves? To do this, CO2 diffusion within a leaf is examined first. Because affinity of Rubisco for CO2 is low, the carboxylation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is competitively inhibited by O2, and the oxygenation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate leads to energy-consuming photorespiration, it is essential for C3 plants to maintain the CO2 concentration in the chloroplast as high as possible. Since the internal conductance for CO2 diffusion from the intercellular space to the chloroplast stroma is finite and relatively small, C3 leaves should have sufficient mesophyll surfaces occupied by chloroplasts to secure the area for CO2 dissolution and transport. This explains why sun leaves are thicker. The second approach is mechanistic or `how-oriented'. Mechanisms are discussed as to how sun leaves become thicker than shade leaves, in particular, the long-distance signal transduction from mature leaves to leaf primordia inducing the periclinal division of the palisade tissue cells. To increase the mesophyll surface area, the leaf can either be thicker or have smaller cells. Issues of cell size are discussed to understand plasticity in leaf thickness.},

  abstract = {Light pollution is the presence of unwanted, inappropriate, or excessive artificial lighting. In a descriptive sense, the term "light pollution" refers to the effects of any poorly implemented lighting, during the day or night. Light pollution can be understood not only as a phenomenon resulting from a specific source or kind of pollution, but also as a contributor to the wider, collective impact of various sources of pollution.Although this type of pollution can exist throughout the day, its effects are magnified during the night with the contrast of darkness. It has been estimated that 83 percent of the world's people live under light-polluted skies and that 23 percent of the world's land area is affected by skyglow. The area affected by artificial illumination continues to increase. A major side-effect of urbanization, light pollution is blamed for compromising health, disrupting ecosystems, and spoiling aesthetic environments. Solutions to light pollution are often easy steps like adjusting light fixtures or using more appropriate lightbulbs. However, because it is a human-made phenomenon, addressing its impacts on humans and the wider ecological systems of Earth involves vast societal complexities that overlay light pollution with political, social, and economic considerations.},
