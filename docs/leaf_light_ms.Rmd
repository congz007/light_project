# INTRODUCTION

What is ALAN? Introduction of ALAN.

Artificial light at night(ALAN), consists of artificial light sources emission and the light reflected back from the sky(skyglow), had disturbed ecological processes since the start of 20th century [@Bennie2016; @Longcore2004; @Gaston2013]. 
So far, artificial light at night extends both in intensity covered a large illuminance range from the degree hard to detect to almost daylight and in extent covered more and more World's terrestrial surfaces [@Bennie2016; @Falchi2016].
Oganisms as well as habitats could be effected directly near artificial light at night(ALAN) such as streetlight and indirectly by sky glow scattered from city ALAN at rural-urban continuum.
Ignoring the effect of artificial light at night to multilevel ecological processes doesn't make sense any more, hence came a series of studies on the effect of ALAN. 

## *ALAN studies (effects of ALAN)*

Artificial light at night calls effects among wild taxonomic groups both zoology and botany, from mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, fishes, invertebrates and plants etc.[@Rich2006]
Typically, lighted towers and glow of city lights confuse migrating birds, and streetlight attracting sea turtle hatchlings which dead parched. 
Recently study shows ALAN is an important bringer to drive insects population decline [@Boyes2021; @Owens2020].
And to plants, biomass would increase responsing to ALAN and show difference between widely and less‐widely naturalized alien plants[@Speißer2021].
Generally, artificial light at night could cause ecological effects spanning trophic levels, and the impacts depends on the wavelengths[@Bennie2018].
However, no rigorous studies have examined effects of artificial light at night on plants in conditions close to their natural environment.

## *Effects of ALAN on leaf traits* (including your expectation) (soil N up -> LMA decrease) (nutrient and LMA)

In previous study, it has been demonstrated that nitrogen contents per unit leaf area $N_a$ increased with environmental nitrogen contents, while LMA shows different correlation decreasing with N supply [@Jullien2009; @An2008].
@Wright2019 shows nutrients clearly limit tropical forest plants, and especially the limitation of N and P in both lowland and montane forests. 
Hence, besides the direct effect from ALAN nutrients condition of the plants should also jump into our sight.
By the light compass theory [@Baker1978; @Sotthibandhu1979] that insects orient themselves by maintaining a constant angle to light rays, artificial light at night plays a role of sink attracting insects which replaces the role of the moon and stars to a great extent.
Further more, it's been showed that about 30%–40% of insects die soon thereafter approaching street lamps for collision, overheating, dehydration, or predation [@Minnaar2015; @Owens2018].
Then comes our research hypothesis that ALAN would decrease LMA of plants around it indirectly as a side-effect of gathering phototaxis insects which chagnes the nutrients condition by distance.

## Effect of (day)light (LMA increase) *light and LMA*

Although LMA driven by inherent genetic mechanisms[@Asner2011], environmental stresses (temperature, water and light) also shapes LMA.
Acually, plants could sense light through photorecpetors which allows the plant to respond to four parameters of their light environment: light spectral quality, light intensity, light direction, and light duration[@Paik2019; @Rich2006].
For individual species, LMA was proportional with species distributions along the insolation gradient, and was significantly higher in evergreen versus deciduous species[@Ackerly2002; @Onoda2008; @Niinemets2004].
Here, ALAN could be considered as a conduct of prolonging light duration to plants so LMA could increase with that.



## Objectives 
a) ALAN indirectly gathering insects increase the soil nutrients(N,P) so that LMA
b) ALAN directly increases LMA (same as daylight)
c) interaction 
In this study we set light experiment and choose two species representing sun species and shade species respectively on understory in man-made rubber tree forest.

**experimental setup**

The field experiment is located within the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden(XTBG),China in rubber tree forest(N21°54' E101°16') where we totally set 5 plots.
LED (10w) is used to create an artificial light environment in all plots at night. The LED system includes 6 components. 
A metal box with an opening is used as a rainproof protector which is attached to a tree at around 1.2 m from the ground. 
A rechargeable lithium battery (12v/30Ah) and an electric timer controls the timing and duration of the LED light operation at night.
An electric wire was used to connect battery and LED which was hanging from a tree branch with a lampshade at approximately 2 m from the ground. 

Considering the understory condition (individual numbers, distribution of individuals) and specific species(it should be evergreen species,also avoiding the nitrogen fix plants like Leguminosae) of each plot, finally two species respectively in two plots were chosen for our study , Gigantea (Blume) Hook. f. representing shade species and (Melastoma candidum D. Don) for sun species.
This experiment started from 2019 November, and samples were catched on 2021 November.

**Measurements**

We measured the horizontal distance and geographic orientation of each individual away from the LED using tape measure representing the relative light strength.
Canopy openness was selected to be on behalf of day light, which photographed by Nikon COOLPIX4500 with fish-eye lens(Nikon FC-e8) then measured using R package "LeafArea"(Katabuchi2015).
For leaf mass per area(LMA), we use leaf disc(10mm^2) punched from leaf avoiding vein and leaf margin instead of whole-leaf to calculate LMA value.


**Data Analysis**

To analyze the effects of ALAN, daylight's effect, and their interaction on both **Melastoma candidum D. Don** and **Colocasia gigantea (Blume) Hook. f.**.
We fitted a Bayesian linear mixed-effets model using 'rstan' package() in R().
Leaf mass per area(LMA) of each leaf of each individual was the response variable.
Distance from the ALAN of each individual was transformed by log then reciprocal, which make sense for both the accumulation of insects and the intensity of ALAN fade away from distance.
We conducted individual as a random effect for each species on our model, for the non-independence of individuals of the same species.

# RESULT
For species Melastoma candidum D. Don, no specific effects of ALAN has been found(95% confidence interval of coefficients covers zero, Table.1)
For Colocasia gigantea (Blume) Hook. f. both ALAN's effect and daylight's effect are significant (95% confidence interval doesn't cover zero)
We found no significant interaction between ALAN's effect and daylight's effect shows no significance.
While we can see the effect coefficients show the same trend for both species, which ALAN causes a negative effect on LMA.




# DISCUSSION
specific species should add to the consider of ALAN effects.
Different type of plants may have different responses.

more experiment and modeling are needed to further research.

(quantify the full-time plant light intercepts can be considered in the future study)
To understand
fully the extent of these impacts requires conceptual models that can (i) characterize the highly
heterogeneous nature of the night-time light environment at a scale relevant to plant physiology; and
(ii) scale physiological responses to predict impacts at the level of the whole plant, population, community
and ecosystem. Bennie2016
