  abstract = {We examined variation in leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA) in relation to the distribution of 22 chaparral shrub species on small-scale gradients of aspect and elevation. Potential incident solar radiation (insolation) was estimated from a geographic information system to quantify microclimate affinities of these species across north- and south-facing slopes. At the community level, leaf size and SLA both declined with increasing insolation, based on average trait values for the species found in plots along the gradient. However, leaf size and SLA were not significantly correlated across species, suggesting that these two traits are decoupled and associated with different aspects of performance along this environmental gradient. For individual species, SLA was negatively correlated with species distributions along the insolation gradient, and was significantly lower in evergreen versus deciduous species. Leaf size exhibited a negative but non-significant trend in relation to insolation distribution of individual species. At the community level, variance in leaf size increased with increasing insolation. For individual species, there was a greater range of leaf size on south-facing slopes, while there was an absence of small-leaved species on northfacing slopes. These results demonstrate that analyses of plant functional traits along environmental gradients based on community level averages may obscure important aspects of trait variation and distribution among the constituent species.},

The primary damage occurs within the reaction center of Photosystem II (PS II). While irreversible photoinduced damage to PS II occurs at all light intensities, the efficiency of photosynthetic electron transfer decreases markedly only when the rate of damage exceeds the rate of its repair, which requires de novo PS II protein synthesis. Photoinhibition has been studied for over a century using a large variety of biochemical, biophysical and genetic methodologies. The discovery of the light induced turnover of a protein, encoded by the plastid psbA gene (the D1 protein), later identified as one of the photochemical reaction center II proteins, has led to the elucidation of the underlying mechanism of photoinhibition and to a deeper understanding of the PS II `life cycle.'},

  abstract = {Plants have evolved diverse life history strategies to succeed in Earth's varied environments. Some species grow quickly, produce copious seeds, and die within a few weeks. Other species grow slowly and rarely produce seeds but live thousands of years. We show that simple morphological measurements can predict where a species falls within the global range of life history strategies: species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have population growth rates influenced primarily by survival, whereas individual growth and fecundity have a stronger influence on the dynamics of species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. This finding increases the ability of scientists to represent complex population processes with a few easily measured character traits., Ecologists seek general explanations for the dramatic variation in species abundances in space and time. An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.},

We collected top-of-canopy leaf samples from 2873 individuals in 57 sites spread across the Neotropics, Australasia, and Caribbean and Pacific Islands to quantify environmental and taxonomic drivers of LMA variation, and to advance remote-sensing measures of LMA. We uncovered strong taxonomic organization of LMA, with species accounting for 70\% of the global variance and up to 62\% of the variation within a forest stand. Climate, growth habit, and site conditions are secondary contributors (1\textendash 23\%) to the observed LMA patterns. Intraspecific variation in LMA averages 16\%, which is a fraction of the variation observed between species. We then used spectroscopic remote sensing (400\textendash 2500 nm) to estimate LMA with an absolute uncertainty of 14\textendash 15 g/m2 (r2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.85), or ;10\% of the global mean. With radiative transfer modeling, we demonstrated the scalability of spectroscopic remote sensing of LMA to the canopy level.

There has been some evaluation of the factors influencing the size of light trap catches1-5 and of the mechanics of the terminal phase of the moth's approach to a light6, but virtually nothing is understood about the light-trap response itself. Such an understanding is perhaps unnecessary when light traps are used solely to collect specimens, but becomes crucial as soon as they are used for quantitative sampling or survey work7. Of particular importance to the interpretation of such work is a knowledge of the distance from which moths orientate with respect to a light source; it seems intuitively that this distance should be fairly large. We present here the results of three experiments designed to determine the distance of response of free-flying moths to an artificial light source. Our results support Sotthibandhu's claim4 that the effective range of a 125 W mercury vapour (MV) lamp is about 3 m. They also lead to speculation concerning the behavioural meaning of the light trap response in moths.},

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

We define a stochastic model where the predators and prey dynamically interact. The novelty of the model holds on the fact that predators and prey dynamics are simultaneously affected by correlated environ\- mental noises. Interacting predators and prey are harvested using a proportional threshold harvesting strategy that accounts for stochastic population dynamics. Optimal yield of prey can be obtained with identical harvesting strategies when the predators and prey responded to the environment similarly (i.e., synchrony between species) and differently (i.e., asynchrony between species). Remarkably, our study demonstrates that two different har\- vesting strategies, the proportional harvesting strategy for the prey and the proportional threshold harvesting strategy for the predators, are needed to optimize the annual yield of predators and prey when both species are harvested simultaneously. Our study finds optimal strategies for harvesting interacting species affected by environmental variations (i.e., correlated noises) with parameters representing the joint dynamics of predators and prey at a stable state.},

  abstract = {Human settlements and transport networks are growing rapidly worldwide. Since the early 20th century their expansion has been accompanied by increasing illumination of the environment at night, a trend that is likely to continue over the decades to come. Consequently, a growing proportion of the world's ecosystems are exposed to artificial light at night, profoundly altering natural cycles of light and darkness. While in recent years there have been advances in our understanding of the effects of artificial light at night on the behaviour and physiology of animals in the wild, much less is known about the impacts on wild plants and natural or semi-natural vegetation composition. This is surprising, as effects of low-intensity light at night on flowering, phenology and growth form are well known in laboratory and greenhouse studies. In a long-term experimental field study we exposed a semi-natural grassland to artificial light at intensities and wavelengths typical of those experienced by roadside vegetation under street lighting. We found that lighting affected the trajectory of vegetation change, leading to significant differences in biomass and plant cover in the dominant species. Changes in flowering phenology were variable between years, with grass species flowering between 4 days earlier and 12 days later under artificial light. Policy implications. Our results demonstrate that artificial light, at levels equivalent to those in street-lit environments, can affect species composition in semi-natural vegetation. This highlights the importance of considering artificial light as a driver of vegetation change in urban, suburban and semi-natural ecosystems, and where possible, of minimising or excluding artificial light from habitats of conservation importance.},

In part, their success might stem from a departure from the discovery\textendash dominance trade-off that can promote co-existence in native ant communities, that is, invasive ants are thought to be at the same time behaviorally dominant and faster discoverers of resources, compared to native species. However, it has not yet been tested whether similar asymmetries in behavioral dominance, exploration, and recruitment abilities also exist among invasive species. Here, we establish a dominance hierarchy among four of the most problematic invasive ants (Linepithema humile, Lasius neglectus, Wasmannia auropunctata, Pheidole megacephala) that may be able to arrive and establish in the same areas in the future. To assess behavioral dominance, we used confrontation experiments, testing the aggressiveness in individual and group interactions between all species pairs. In addition, to compare discovery efficiency, we tested the species' capacity to locate a food resource in a maze, and the capacity to recruit nestmates to exploit a food resource. The four species differed greatly in their capacity to discover resources and to recruit nestmates and to dominate the other species. Our results are consistent with a discovery\textendash dominance trade-off. The species that showed the highest level of interspecific aggressiveness and dominance during dyadic interactions.},

There has been extensive theoretical study of the role of such trade-offs in ecological communities but it has proven difficult to study such trade-offs experimentally. Microorganisms are ideal model systems with which to experimentally study the causes and consequences of ecological trade-offs. In model communities of E. coli B and T-type bacteriophage, a trade-off in E. coli between resistance to bacteriophage and competitive ability is often observed. This trade-off can allow the coexistence of different ecological types of E. coli. The magnitude of this trade-off affects, in predictable ways, the structure, dynamics and response to environmental change of these communities. Genetic factors, environmental factors, and gene-by-environment interactions determine the magnitude of this trade-off. Environmental control of the magnitude of trade-offs represents one avenue by which environmental change can alter community properties such as invasability, stability and coexistence.},

Despite strong evidence that lighting disrupts a range of insect behaviors, the empirical evidence that ALAN diminishes wild insect abundance is limited. Using a matched-pairs design, we found that street lighting strongly reduced moth caterpillar abundance compared with unlit sites (47\% reduction in hedgerows and 33\% reduction in grass margins) and affected caterpillar development. A separate experiment in habitats with no history of lighting revealed that ALAN disrupted the feeding behavior of nocturnal caterpillars. Negative impacts were more pronounced under white light-emitting diode (LED) street lights compared to conventional yellow sodium lamps. This indicates that ALAN and the ongoing shift toward white LEDs (i.e., narrow- to broad-spectrum lighting) will have substantial consequences for insect populations and ecosystem processes.},

  abstract = {The night-time environment is increasingly being lit, often by broad-spectrum lighting, and there is growing evidence that artificial light at night (ALAN) has consequences for ecosystems, potentially contributing to declines in insect populations. Moths are species-rich, sensitive to ALAN, and have undergone declines in Europe, making them the ideal group for investigating the impacts of light pollution on nocturnal insects more broadly. Here, we take a life cycle approach to review the impacts of ALAN on moths, drawing on a range of disciplines including ecology, physiology, and applied entomology. We find evidence of diverse impacts across most life stages and key behaviours. Many studies have examined flight-to-light behaviour in adults and our meta-analysis found that mercury vapour, metal halide, and compact fluorescent bulbs induce this more than LED and sodium lamps. However, we found that ALAN can also disrupt reproduction, larval development, and pupal diapause, with likely negative impacts on individual fitness, and that moths can be indirectly affected via hostplants and predators. These findings indicate that ALAN could also affect day-flying insects through impacts on earlier life stages. Overall, we found strong evidence for effects of artificial light on moth behaviour and physiology, but little rigorous, direct evidence that this scales up to impacts on populations. Crucially, there is a need to determine the potential contribution of ALAN to insect declines, relative to other drivers of change. In the meantime, we recommend precautionary strategies to mitigate possible negative effects of ALAN on insect populations.},

To this end we assemble a panel data set of sea turtle nesting activity and satellite-derived measures of nighttime light. Controlling for the surveyor effort, the local economic infrastructure, and spatial spillovers, we find that nighttime light significantly reduces the number of sea turtle nests. According to data on replacement costs for sea turtles raised in captivity, our result suggests that the increase in lighting over the last two decades has resulted in the loss of close to 1800 sea turtles in the Caribbean, worth up to \$288 million. Incorporating our empirical estimates into a stage-structured population model, we discover that the dynamic effect of nighttime light on future generations of sea turtles is likely to be much larger, with a cost of approximately \$2.8 billion for Guadeloupe alone. More generally, our study provides a new approach to valuing the cost of environmental pollution associated with species extinction.},

Second, that the individual modulates its behaviour and physiology in response to the instantaneous ratio of mobilizable to non-mobilizable tissues. 3. The model is parameterized for salmonids from published studies of their energetics. Data from aquaculture studies of fish growth under conditions of fluctuating food are used to test the model. Using a common parameter set, the model successfully reproduces the growth patterns observed in 16 different feeding regimes.}

Long-lived species are more likely to have large, non-dormant seeds that are dispersed far. Our findings provide robust support for the theoretical prediction of a dispersal trade-off between space and time, implying that a joint consideration of risk-spreading strategies is imperative in studying plant life-history evolution.

  abstract = {Long-term surveys of entire communities of species are needed to measure fluctuations in natural populations and elucidate the mechanisms driving population dynamics and community assembly. We analysed changes in abundance of over 4000 tree species in 12 forests across the world over periods of 6\textendash 28 years. Abundance fluctuations in all forests are large and consistent with population dynamics models in which temporal environmental variance plays a central role. At some sites we identify clear environmental drivers, such as fire and drought, that could underlie these patterns, but at other sites there is a need for further research to identify drivers. In addition, cross-site comparisons showed that abundance fluctuations were smaller at species-rich sites, consistent with the idea that stable environmental conditions promote higher diversity. Much community ecology theory emphasises demographic variance and niche stabilisation; we encourage the development of theory in which temporal environmental variance plays a central role.},

Based on radiance-calibrated high-resolution DMSP satellite data and on accurate modelling of light propagation in the atmosphere, it provides a nearly global picture of how mankind is proceeding to envelop itself in a luminous fog. Comparing the Atlas with the United States Department of Energy (DOE) population density data base, we determined the fraction of population who are living under a sky of given brightness. About two-thirds of the World population and 99 per cent of the population in the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) and European Union live in areas where the night sky is above the threshold set for polluted status. Assuming average eye functionality, about one-fifth of the World population, more than two-thirds of the United States population and more than one half of the European Union population have already lost naked eye visibility of the Milky Way. Finally, about onetenth of the World population, more than 40 per cent of the United States population and one sixth of the European Union population no longer view the heavens with the eye adapted to night vision, because of the sky brightness.},

Leaf mass per area, which is influenced by both leaf thickness and density (LMA\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}thickness\hspace{0.25em}\texttimes\hspace{0.25em}density), generally increases from the bottom to the top of tree canopies, yet the mechanisms behind this universal pattern are not yet resolved. For decades, the light environment was assumed to be the most influential driver of within-canopy variation in LMA, yet recent evidence has shown hydrostatic gradients to be more important in upper canopy positions, especially in tall evergreen trees in temperate and tropical forests. The aim of this study was to disentangle the importance of various environmental drivers on vertical LMA gradients in a mature sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) forest. We compared LMA, leaf density and leaf thickness relationships with height, light and predawn leaf water potential ({$\Psi$}Pre) within a closed and an exposed canopy to assess leaf morphological traits at similar heights but different light conditions. Contrary to our expectations and recent findings in the literature, we found strong evidence that light was the primary driver of vertical gradients in leaf morphology. At similar heights (13\textendash 23\hspace{0.25em}m), LMA was greater within the exposed canopy than the closed canopy, and light had a stronger influence over LMA compared with {$\Psi$}Pre. Light also had a stronger influence over both leaf thickness and density compared with {$\Psi$}Pre; however, the increase in LMA within both canopy types was primarily due to increasing leaf thickness with increasing light availability. This study provides strong evidence that canopy structure and crown exposure, in addition to height, should be considered as a parameter for determining vertical patterns in LMA and modeling canopy function.},

  abstract = {Within-canopy gradients of leaf functional traits have been linked to both light availability and vertical gradients in leaf water potential. While observational studies can reveal patterns in leaf traits, within-canopy experimental manipulations can provide mechanistic insight to tease apart multiple interacting drivers. Our objectives were to disentangle effects of height and light environment on leaf functional traits by experimentally shading branches along vertical gradients within a sugar maple (Acer saccharum) forest. Shading reduced leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf density, area-based leaf nitrogen (Narea), and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, and increased mass-based leaf nitrogen (Nmass), highlighting the importance of light availability on leaf morphology and chemistry. Early in the growing season, midday leaf water potential ({$\Psi$}mid), LMA, and Narea were driven primarily by height; later in the growing season, light became the most important driver for LMA and Narea. Carbon isotope composition ({$\delta$}13C) displayed strong, linear correlations with height throughout the growing season, but did not change with shading, implying that height is more influential than light on water use efficiency and stomatal behavior. LMA, leaf density, Nmass, C:N ratio, and {$\delta$}13C all changed seasonally, suggesting that leaf ageing effects on leaf functional traits are equally as important as microclimatic conditions. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) stomatal sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit or {$\Psi$}mid constrains the supply of CO2 to leaves at higher heights, independent of light environment, and (2) LMA and Narea distributions become functionally optimized through morphological acclimation to light with increasing leaf age despite height-related constraints.},

  abstract = {1. A central tenet of life-history theory is that investment in reproduction compromises survival. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms that link reproduction to survival are poorly understood, particularly in wild populations. 2. Previous experiments in the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) show that the elimination of reproduction via surgical ovariectomy results in a dramatic increase in the survival of wild females. We hypothesized that this trade-off reflects underlying differences in energy allocation between reproduction and physiological processes that influence survival. 3. To test this hypothesis, we compared ovariectomized (OVX) females to reproductive controls (SHAM) with respect to four physiological parameters that are thought to influence survival: energy storage, haematocrit, immune function and parasitemia. 4. Consistent with previous studies, we found that OVX females exhibited increased survival and growth relative to reproductive SHAM females. At the end of the breeding season, OVX also exceeded SHAM with respect to energy storage, haematocrit and immune response to phytohemagglutinin challenge. 5. Contrary to our predictions, OVX were more likely than SHAM to exhibit high levels of parasitemia. However, growth and parasite load were positively correlated in OVX and negatively correlated in SHAM, suggesting that reproductive investment may compromise parasite tolerance rather than parasite resistance. 6. Collectively, our results provide direct experimental evidence that reproductive investment affects several key physiological traits that likely interact to influence survival in wild populations.},

  abstract = {ForestGEO is a network of scientists and long-term forest dynamics plots (FDPs) spanning the Earth's major forest types. ForestGEO's mission is to advance understanding of the diversity and dynamics of forests and to strengthen global capacity for forest science research. ForestGEO is unique among forest plot networks in its large-scale plot dimensions, censusing of all stems {$\geq$}1 cm in diameter, inclusion of tropical, temperate and boreal forests, and investigation of additional biotic (e.g., arthropods) and abiotic (e.g., soils) drivers, which together provide a holistic view of forest functioning. The 71 FDPs in 27 countries include approximately 7.33 million living trees and about 12,000 species, representing 20\% of the world's known tree diversity. With {$>$}1300 published papers, ForestGEO researchers have made significant contributions in two fundamental areas: species coexistence and diversity, and ecosystem functioning. Specifically, defining the major biotic and abiotic controls on the distribution and coexistence of species and functional types and on variation in species' demography has led to improved understanding of how the multiple dimensions of forest diversity are structured across space and time and how this diversity relates to the processes controlling the role of forests in the Earth system. Never\- theless, knowledge gaps remain that impede our ability to predict how forest diversity and function will respond to climate change and other stressors. Meeting these global research challenges requires major advances in standardizing taxonomy of tropical species, resolving the main drivers of forest dynamics, and integrating plotbased ground and remote sensing observations to scale up estimates of forest diversity and function, coupled with improved predictive models. However, they cannot be met without greater financial commitment to sustain the long-term research of ForestGEO and other forest plot networks, greatly expanded scientific capacity across the world's forested nations, and increased collaboration and integration among research networks and disciplines addressing forest science.},

However, it is widely observed that Na declines less rapidly than light in real plant canopies. Here we show that this general observation can be explained by optimal leaf acclimation to light subject to a lower-bound constraint on the leaf mass per area (ma). Using a simple model of the carbon\textendash nitrogen (C\textendash N) balance of trees with a steady-state canopy, we implement this constraint within the framework of the MAXX optimization hypothesis that maximizes net canopy C export. Virtually all canopy traits predicted by MAXX (leaf N gradient, leaf N concentration, leaf photosynthetic capacity, canopy N content, leaf-area index) are in close agreement with the values observed in a mature stand of Norway spruce trees (Picea abies L. Karst.). An alternative upperbound constraint on leaf photosynthetic capacity (Asat) does not reproduce the canopy traits of this stand. MAXX subject to a lower bound on ma is also qualitatively consistent with co-variations in leaf N gradient, ma and Asat observed across a range of temperate and tropical tree species. Our study highlights the key role of constraints in optimization models of plant function.},

This necessarily means that rare alleles that can be acted on by selection appear to experience high levels of frequency-dependence selection. However, selection may act on multiple traits at any one time.               Doebeli and Ispolatov               (p.               494               ) present a theoretical framework examining how multiple rare traits can persist and potentially drive speciation. The s show that only low levels of frequency-dependent selection are needed to explain the observed high levels of allelic diversity in nature.                        ,              Eco-evolutionary models of selection acting on multiple traits show how rare alleles can establish and drive speciation.           ,              The mechanisms for the origin and maintenance of biological diversity are not fully understood. It is known that frequency-dependent selection, generating advantages for rare types, can maintain genetic variation and lead to speciation, but in models with simple phenotypes (that is, low-dimensional phenotype spaces), frequency dependence needs to be strong to generate diversity. However, we show that if the ecological properties of an organism are determined by multiple traits with complex interactions, the conditions needed for frequency-dependent selection to generate diversity are relaxed to the point where they are easily satisfied in high-dimensional phenotype spaces. Mathematically, this phenomenon is reflected in properties of eigenvalues of quadratic forms.

Community-weighted leaf traits were calculated for 57 plots within the forest. Links between LMA, LDMC and other leaf traits were analysed at the species and the community level using standardised major axis (SMA) regressions Results LMA and LDMC were significantly related to many leaf nutrient concentrations, but only when using abundance-weighted values at community level. Among-traits links were much weaker for the crossspecies analysis. Nitrogen isotopic signatures were useful to understand different resource-use strategies. Community-weighted LMA and LDMC were negatively related to light availability, contrary to what was expected. Conclusion Community leaf traits have parallel shifts along the environmental factors that determine the community assembly, even though they are weakly related across individual taxa. Light availability is the main environmental factor determining this convergence of the community leaf traits.},

Here we aimed to assess how their variation, within and between species, tracks environmental gradients. Measurements were made on 705 species from 116 sites within a broad north\textendash south transect from tropical to temperate Australia. Trait responses to environment were quantified using multiple regression; within- and between-species responses were compared using analysis of covariance and trait-gradient analysis. Leaf area, the leaf economics spectrum (indexed by LMA and Narea) and {$\chi$} (from stable carbon isotope ratios) varied almost independently among species. Across sites, however, {$\chi$} and LA increased with mean growing-season temperature (mGDD0) and decreased with vapour pressure deficit (mVPD0) and soil pH. LMA and Narea showed the reverse pattern. Climate responses agreed with expectations based on optimality principles. Within-species variability contributed {$<$} 10\% to geographical variation in LA but {$>$} 90\% for {$\chi$}, with LMA and Narea intermediate. These findings support the hypothesis that acclimation within individuals, adaptation within species and selection among species combine to create predictable relationships between traits and environment. However, the contribution of acclimation/adaptation vs species selection differs among traits.},

We used a large compilation of plant biomass and size observations, including observations of 21 084 individuals on 656 species. We used a combination of semiparametric methods and variance partitioning to test the influence of PFT, plant height, LMA, total leaf area, stem basal area and climate on above-ground biomass distribution. The ratio of leaf mass to above-ground woody mass (MF/MS) varied strongly among PFTs. We found that MF/MS at a given plant height was proportional to LMA across PFTs. As a result, the PFTs did not differ in the amount of leaf area supported per unit above-ground biomass or per unit stem basal area. Climate consistently explained very little additional variation in biomass distribution at a given plant size. Combined, these results demonstrate consistent patterns in above-ground biomass distribution and leaf area relationships among major woody PFTs, which can be used to further constrain global vegetation models.},

Pollution is a main driver of pollinator decline. Light and noise pollution are more intense in cities than in any other ecosystem. Although nocturnal pollinators are heavily exposed to these pollutants, their effect on bat pollination is still unknown. Our goal was to assess the effect of light and noise pollution on the main pollination components (pollinator visits, pollen transfer, pollen germination, fruit, and seed set) of the tropical tree, Ceiba pentandra, in a heavily urbanized ecosystem. We measured these components in sites with contrasting intensities of artificial light and anthropogenic noise and statistically assessed the direct and indirect effect of pollutants on pollination components using structural equation modeling. We found that noise and light pollution negatively affected the visits by the bats that pollinate C. pentandra. However, these negative effects did not affect posterior pollination components. In fact, the direct effect of light pollution on reproductive success was positive and greater than the indirect effects via pollinator visits. We suggest that illuminated trees may be able to sustain a large quantity of fruits and seeds because they produce more photosynthates due to greater light radiation and delayed leaf abscission. We conclude that, despite the negative effect of light and noise on pollinator visits, these pollutants did not significantly impact the reproductive success of C. pentandra.},

  abstract = {Trade-offs between functional traits are ubiquitous in nature and can promote species coexistence depending on their shape. Classic theory predicts that convex trade-offs facilitate coexistence of specialized species with extreme trait values (extreme species) while concave trade-offs promote species with intermediate trait values (intermediate species). We show here that this prediction becomes insufficient when the traits translate non-linearly into fitness which frequently occurs in nature, e.g., an increasing length of spines reduces grazing losses only up to a certain threshold resulting in a saturating or sigmoid trait-fitness function. We present a novel, general approach to evaluate the effect of different trade-off shapes on species coexistence. We compare the trade-off curve to the invasion boundary of an intermediate species invading the two extreme species. At this boundary, the invasion fitness is zero. Thus, it separates trait combinations where invasion is or is not possible. The invasion boundary is calculated based on measurable trait\textendash fitness relationships. If at least one of these relationships is not linear, the invasion boundary becomes non-linear, implying that convex and concave trade-offs not necessarily lead to different coexistence patterns. Therefore, we suggest a new ecological classification of trade-offs into extreme-favoring and intermediate-favoring which differs from a purely mathematical description of their shape. We apply our approach to a well-established model of an empirical predator\textendash prey system with competing prey types facing a trade-off between edibility and half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake. We show that the survival of the intermediate prey depends on the convexity of the trade-off. Overall, our approach provides a general tool to make a priori predictions on the outcome of competition among species facing a common trade-off in dependence of the shape of the trade-off and the shape of the trait\textendash fitness relationships.},

To these ends, experimental stemwood production data from 2012 to 2017 from eight Eucalyptus clones distributed over 23 locations with contrasting environmental conditions in Brazil were used. The APSIM Next Generation Eucalyptus model, when properly adapted and calibrated, performed well in simulating stemwood biomass and volume, basal area and leaf area index in subtropical and tropical regions and for different genetic entries. For stemwood biomass, the R2 ranged from 0.76 to 0.93 and the Willmott Agreement Index ranged from 0.93 to 0.98, indicating satisfactory precision and accuracy, respectively.

  abstract = {We introduce an Interaction- and Trade-off-based Eco-Evolutionary Model (ITEEM), in which species are competing in a well-mixed system, and their evolution in interaction trait space is subject to a life-history trade-off between replication rate and competitive ability. We demonstrate that the shape of the trade-off has a fundamental impact on eco-evolutionary dynamics, as it imposes four phases of diversity, including a sharp phase transition. Despite its minimalism, ITEEM produces a remarkable range of patterns of eco-evolutionary dynamics that are observed in experimental and natural systems. Most notably we find self-organization towards structured communities with high and sustained diversity, in which competing species form interaction cycles similar to rock-paper-scissors games., A patch of rain forest, a coral reef, a pond, and the microbes in our guts are all examples of biological communities. More generally, a community is a group of organisms that live together at the same place and time. Many communities are composed of a large number of different species, and this diversity is maintained for long times., Although diversity is a key feature of biological communities, the mechanisms that generate and maintain diversity are not well understood. Research had hinted at links between diversity and the trade-offs that species are subject to. For instance, there is a trade-off between competitiveness and reproduction: if there are limited resources in the environment a species may either produce many offspring that are not very competitive, or fewer, more competitive offspring., Farahpour et al. have now simulated the development of communities of organisms that reproduce, compete, and die in a uniform environment. Crucially, these computational simulations introduced a trade-off between competitive ability and reproduction., The simulations show that the form of trade-off has a fundamental impact on diversity: moderate trade-offs favor diversity, whereas extreme trade-offs suppress diversity. The simulations also revealed mechanisms that underlie how diversity is generated. In particular, cyclic relationships emerge where one species dominates another but is also dominated by a third, similar to the rock-paper-scissors game., Since Farahpour et al. used a bare-bone model with only a few essential features the results could apply to a larger class of community-like systems whose evolution is driven by competition. This includes economic and social systems as well as biological communities.},

Speciation is the process primarily responsible for this great diversity of life.

We begin by defining the speciation problem as one involving the evolution of barriers to genetic exchange between populations, with the product being differentiated species that maintain their distinction if, when, and where they happen to co-occur. We then categorize the major different types of barriers to genetic exchange and outline several different modes of speciation (largely geographically defined) under which these barriers can evolve. We next elaborate on different mechanisms that can underlie the evolution of reproductive isolation and the formation of new species. We conclude by discussing future avenues of research, including the study of the genomics of speciation and new developments in the field.},

Microbiologists should be aware that all of these traits are subject to constraints imposed by trade-offs, so adaptations improving one trait may be at the cost of another. A deeper appreciation of trade-offs is thus crucial for assessing the mechanistic limits on important bacterial characteristics. Studies of the negative correlations between various traits have revealed three molecular mechanisms, namely, trade-offs involving resource allocation, design constraint, and information processing. This review further discusses why these trade-off mechanisms are important in the establishment of models capable of predicting bacterial competition, coexistence, and sources of diversity.},

This ``worldwide leaf economics spectrum'' consists of a suite of intercorrelated leaf traits, among which leaf mass per area, LMA, is one of the most fundamental as it indicates the cost of leaf construction and light-interception borne by plants. We conducted a broad-scale analysis of the evolutionary history of LMA across a large dataset of 5401 vascular plant species. The phylogenetic signal in LMA displayed low but significant conservatism, that is, leaf economics tended to be more similar among close relatives than expected by chance alone. Models of trait evolution indicated that LMA evolved under weak stabilizing selection. Moreover, results suggest that different optimal phenotypes evolved among large clades within which extremes tended to be selected against. Conservatism in LMA was strongly related to growth form, as were selection intensity and phenotypic evolutionary rates: woody plants showed higher conservatism in relation to stronger stabilizing selection and lower evolutionary rates compared to herbaceous taxa. The evolutionary history of LMA thus paints different evolutionary trajectories of vascular plant species across clades, revealing the coordination of leaf trait evolution with growth forms in response to varying selection regimes.},

  abstract = {Nutrient addition experiments indicate that nitrogen and phosphorus limit plant processes in many tropical forests. However, the long-term consequences for forest structure and species composition remain unexplored. We are positioned to evaluate potential long-term consequences of nutrient addition in central Panama where we have maintained a factorial nitrogen\textendash phosphorus\textendash potassium fertilization experiment for 21 yr and an independent study quantified the species-specific nutrient requirements of 550 local tree species. Here, we ask whether nutrients limit reproduction at the species and community levels. We also ask whether species-specific reproductive responses to nutrient addition are stronger among species associated with naturally fertile soils, which could contribute to a shift in species composition. We quantified species-level reproductive responses for 38 focal species in the 21st year of the experiment and community-level reproductive litter production for the first 20 yr. Species-level reproductive responses to nitrogen and potassium addition were weak, inconsistent across species, and insignificant across the 38 focal species. In contrast, species-level responses to phosphorus addition were consistently and significantly positive across the 38 focal species but were unrelated to species-specific phosphorus requirements documented independently for the same species. Community-level reproductive litter production was unaffected by nutrient addition, possibly because spatial and temporal variation is large. We conclude that phosphorus limits reproduction by trees in our experiment but find no evidence that reproductive responses to phosphorus addition favor species associated with naturally phosphorus-rich soils.},

  abstract = {The light-dependent generation of active oxygen species is termed photooxidative stress. This can occur in two ways: (1) the donation of energy or electrons directly to oxygen as a result of photosynthetic activity; (2) exposure of tissues to ultraviolet irradiation. The light-dependent destruction of catalase compounds the problem. Although generally detrimental to metabolism, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide may serve useful functions if rigorously controlled and compartmentalised. During photosynthesis the formation of active oxygen species is minimised by a number of complex and refined regulatory mechanisms. When produced, active oxygen species are eliminated rapidly by efficient antioxidative systems. The chloroplast is able to use the production and destruction of hydrogen peroxide to regulate the thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy. This is an intrinsic feature of the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport. Photoinhibition and photooxidation only usually occur when plants are exposed to stress. Active oxygen species are part of the alarm-signalling processes in plants. These serve to modify metabolism and gene expression so that the plant can respond to adverse environmental conditions, invading organisms and ultraviolet irradiation. The capacity of the antioxidative defense system is often increased at such times but if the response is not sufficient, radical production will exceed scavenging and ultimately lead to the disruption of metabolism. Oxidative damage arises in high light principally when the latter is in synergy with additional stress factors such as chilling temperatures or pollution. Environmental stress can modify the photooxidative processes in various ways ranging from direct involvement in light-induced free radical formation to the inhibition of metabolism that renders previously optimal light levels excessive. It is in just such situations that the capacity for the production of active oxygen species can exceed that for scavenging by the antioxidative defense systems. The advent of plant transformation, however, may have placed within our grasp the possibility of engineering greater stress tolerance in plants by enhancement of the antioxidative defence system.},

L. pulmonaria showed a clear trade-off between growth and reproductive efforts. Increased reproductive efforts decreased the area growth to a larger extent than the weight gain, meaning that reproduction increased with increasing lobe thickness and presumably increasing lobe age.

Here we expanded our investigation to 51 species, representing 96\% of individual plants recorded over 30 years, and analysed trait relationships in the context of species abundance and phylogenetic relationships. We found that the functional-trait trade-off scales to the entire community, albeit with diminished strength.

Lianas showed trade-offs similar to those of trees, with both groups exhibiting broadly overlapping ranges in survival and relative growth rates as seedlings. Life history strategies at the seedling stage were highly correlated with those at the sapling stage among tree species, with all species showing an increase in survival with size. Only one of 30 tree species demonstrated a statistically significant ontogenetic shift, having a relatively lower survival rate at the sapling stage than expected. Our results indicate that similar life history trade-offs apply across two functional groups (lianas and trees), and that life history strategies are largely conserved across seedling and sapling life-stages for most tropical tree species.},

Canopy structural parameters are usually described using several pseudo-synonymous terms, often measuring different components of vegetation canopies. Standardization in the definitions has fallen short, leading to confusion of terms even in standard text books making the comparison of historic measures futile. Here we clarify concepts that have been used for fractional canopy element cover and openness measures. The fractional canopy element cover and openness concepts considered are canopy closure, canopy cover, canopy openness, crown closure, crown completeness, crown cover, crown porosity, site openness and tilt openness. New methodologies are presented to obtain large scale fractional canopy element cover and openness measures using hemispherical photography. The new methodologies and variations in definitions of fractional canopy element cover and openness concepts are demonstrated using photographic measurements in complex topography. The results indicate that both fractional canopy element cover and openness parameters can be estimated with a few point-based measurements using hemispherical photography. Hemispherical photography is therefore less time, labour and resource intensive, as compared to point based measuring techniques of canopy element cover and openness. Most of the commonly and interchangeably used concepts of fractional canopy element cover and openness measures represent physically different structural properties of a vegetated ecosystem.},

In contrast to this assumption there is a large body of evidence showing that juvenile growth rates may vary adaptively both within and between populations. This adaptive variation implies that high growth rates may be associated with costs. 2. Here, I explicitly evaluate the often-proposed trade-off between growth rate and predation risk, in a study of the temperate butterfly, Pararge aegeria (L). 3. By rearing larvae with a common genetic background in different photoperiods it was possible to experimentally manipulate larval growth rates, which vary in response to photoperiod. Predation risk was assessed by exposing larvae that were freely moving on their host plants to the predatory heteropteran, Picromerus bidens (L.). 4. The rate of predation was significantly higher in the fast-growing larvae. An approximately four times higher relative growth rate was associated with a 30\% higher daily predation risk. 5. The main result demonstrates a trade-off between growth rate and predation risk, and there are reasons to believe that this trade-off is of general significance in free-living animals. The results also suggest that juvenile development of P. aegeria is governed by a strategic decision process within individuals.},

We highlight some of the difficulties with the proposed solutions, and demonstrate that standard quantitative genetic theory and software offer solutions. We also show how results from Bayesian quantitative genetics can be used to create efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for phylogenetic mixed models, thereby extending their generality to non-Gaussian data. Of particular utility is the development of multinomial models for analysing the evolution of discrete traits, and the development of multi-trait models in which traits can follow different distributions. Meta-analyses often include a nonrandom collection of species for which the full phylogenetic tree has only been partly resolved. Using missing data theory, we show how the presented models can be used to correct for nonrandom sampling and show how taxonomies and phylogenies can be combined to give a flexible framework with which to model dependence.},

This paper extends the traditional methodology to incorporate multiple noncommensurate objective functions and use of the conditional expected value of the risk of extreme and catastrophic events. The proposed methodology considers the cases where (a) a finite number of actions are available at each decision node and (b) discrete or continuous states of nature can be presented at each chance node. The proposed extension of decision-tree analysis is introduced through an example problem that leads the reader step-by-step into the methodological procedure. The example problem builds on flood warning systems. Two noncommensurate objectives\textemdash the loss of lives and the loss of property (including monetary costs of the flood warning system)\textendash are incorporated into the decision tree. In addition, two risk measures\textemdash the common expected value and the conditional expected value of extreme and catastrophic events\textemdash are quantified and are also incorporated into the decision-making process. Theoretical difficulties associated with the stage-wise calculation of conditional expected values are identified and certain simplifying assumptions are made for computational tractibility. In particular, it is revealed that decisions concerning experimentation have a very interesting impact on the noninferior solution set of options\textemdash a phenomenon that has no equivalence in the single-objective case.},

  abstract = {The use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

  abstract = {Leaf mechanical strength and photosynthetic capacity are critical plant life-history traits associated with tolerance and growth under various biotic and abiotic stresses. In principle, higher mechanical resistance achieved via higher relative allocation to cell walls should slow photosynthetic rates. However, interspecific relationships among these two leaf functions have not been reported. We measured leaf traits of 57 dominant woody species in a subtropical evergreen forest in China, focusing especially on photosynthetic rates, mechanical properties, and leaf lifespan (LLS). These species were assigned to two ecological strategy groups: shade-tolerant species and light-demanding species. On average, shade-tolerant species had longer LLS, higher leaf mechanical strength but lower photosynthetic rates, and exhibited longer LLS for a given leaf mass per area (LMA) or mechanical strength than light-demanding species. Depending on the traits and the basis of expression (per area or per mass), leaf mechanical resistance and photosynthetic capacity were either deemed unrelated, or only weakly negatively correlated. We found only weak support for the proposed trade-off between leaf biomechanics and photosynthesis among co-occurring woody species. This suggests there is considerable flexibility in these properties, and the observed relationships may result more so from trait coordination than any physically or physiologically enforced trade-off.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have reported a consistent trade-off between leaf size (mass) and leafing intensity (the number of leaves produced per unit of supporting stem tissue volume); however, a theoretical basis for this trade-off has not been described. We explore the mechanistic basis for this trade-off and assess the relationship in the light of other prominent theories for allometric biomass partitioning. We show algebraically how the allocation of mass to leaves versus stems and the density of stem tissue can potentially influence this trade-off. To assess these possible effects, we compared the relationship between leaf size and leafing intensity, expressed on both mass and volume basis, at the level of a single branch as well as the entire above-ground plant in 61 forbs over a 3-year period. Our results support the idea that the trade-off between leaf size and volume-based leafing intensity depends on both biomass investment (leaves vs. stems) and stem bulk density (mass vs. volume), whereas the trade-off between leaf size and mass-based leafing intensity only depends on the biomass investment. Similar exponents in the scaling of leaf mass vs. stem mass and stem mass vs. stem volume at branch and whole plant levels lead to similar trade-offs. An isometric trade-off between leaf size and volume-based leafing intensity is consistent with a constant biomass partitioning between leaves and stems as well as constant stem tissue density. Conversely, an allometric trade-off between leaf size and volume-based leafing intensity arises when biomass allocation is allometric and stem bulk density varies with plant size.},

These tradeoffs have profound implications in agriculture and natural ecosystems, as both processes are vital for plant survival, reproduction, and, ultimately, plant fitness. While many of the molecular mechanisms underlying growth and defense tradeoffs remain to be elucidated, hormone crosstalk has emerged as a major player in regulating tradeoffs needed to achieve a balance. In this review, we cover recent advances in understanding growth\textendash defense tradeoffs in plants as well as what is known regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms. Specifically, we address evidence supporting the growth\textendash defense tradeoff concept, as well as known interactions between defense signaling and growth signaling. Understanding the molecular basis of these tradeoffs in plants should provide a foundation for the development of breeding strategies that optimize the growth\textendash defense balance to maximize crop yield to meet rising global food and biofuel demands.},

  abstract = {1. Tree architecture is thought to allow species to partition horizontal and vertical light gradients in the forest canopy. Tree architecture is closely related to light capture, carbon gain and the efficiency with which trees reach the canopy. Previous studies that investigated how light gradients drive differentiation in tree architecture have produced inconsistent results, partially because of the differences in which tree species and ontogenetic stages were studied. 2. We examined the relationship between stem diameter, tree height, foliage height, crown width and life-history strategy over a broad size range of 200 randomly selected, co-occurring tree species in a lowland rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to account for both intra- and interspecific variation and describe the relationships among tree architectural variables. We analysed interspecific variation in tree architectural variables in relation to adult stature and light requirement for species regeneration as a function of tree size. 3. There was little interspecific variation in architectural variables, this is partly because of large intraspecific variation in response to canopy heterogeneity, but it also suggests architectural convergence within this community. However, interspecific analyses showed that, for large-statured species, small size classes had thinner stems with narrow and shallow crowns, whereas large-size classes had wider crowns. Light-demanding species (as indicated by high sapling mortality in shaded conditions) showed weak trends in tree architecture and were only characterized by wide crowns at intermediate sizes. 4. In summary, tree architectural traits overlapped across the species community. This suggests that architectural convergence and equalizing effects occur in this diverse tropical forest and that community-wide allometric equations can be used to describe forest height and carbon storage. Light resource partitioning also occurs, indicating stabilizing effects. Interspecific architectural variation in relation to adult stature supports the theory of the trade-off between early reproduction and vegetative growth. In closed rainforests, adult stature imposes a stronger force on architectural differentiation of species than regeneration light requirements.},

We used a microbial experimental system to elucidate the shape of the relationship between parasitoid resistance and competitive ability. For each of 86 bacteriophage-resistant isolates of the bacterium Escherichia coli B, we measured the degree of resistance to bacteriophage T2 (a viral parasitoid) and relative competitive ability in both the resource environment in which strains were isolated and in two alternate environments.

Leaves of the main stem of plants sampled between emergence and harvest were surfaced, oven-dried and weighed to calculate LMA of each individual leaf. At the plant level, LMA presented a common ontogenetic trajectory, which increases from seedling emergence to bolting and from then on decreases. Variations in LMA were related to the variations in plant demand, LMA decreased when demand increased. The trajectory was modified by low N nutrition that increased LMA but differently according to year and genotype, reflecting the plant plasticity. At the leaf level, variations for each individual leaf were related to the variations at the plant level. Plant plasticity and genotypic variability of the responses of LMA to N deficiency seemed to be related to differences in biomass allocation between leaves and stems.},

  abstract = {1. Habitat filtering and limiting similarity have been proposed as two opposing forces structuring community memberships. Community assembly theory proposes habitat filtering as a mechanism restricting community membership according to the ecological strategies of species in a given environment. Limiting similarity posits that some species exclude others that are ecologically similar. 2. We quantified nine ecophysiological and life-history traits for 80 dipterocarp species in the 52-ha Lambir Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP; Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia). We studied forests on four soil types differing in fertility and moisture, focusing on soil resource availabilities as environmental determinants of habitat filtering processes. We used a null-model approach to detect the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity. We quantified the relative contributions of soil resources (nutrients and water) to habitat filtering by comparing the strength of habitat filtering processes (i.e. effect sizes) at the overall plot scale and at the individual soil-type scale. We also compared the strengths of assembly processes among soil types. 3. Compared to a null model at microscale (20 \texttimes{} 20 m), trait range and variance were reduced for seven of nine functional traits, suggesting the importance of habitat filtering in the dipterocarp community. We also found a broader distribution of five traits, and more even spacing for seven traits (20 \texttimes{} 20 m), which is consistent with the concept of limiting similarity. Randomizations that swapped species occurrences within soil types (i.e. null models removing soil effects in assembly processes) were much closer to observed values, and there were no phylogenetic constraints on habitat association. Hence, soil resource availability acted as a habitat filtering mechanism in the FDP; relative contributions to habitat filtering ranged from 35\% for seed mass to 77\% for relative growth rate. Furthermore, soil types apparently affected the strengths of habitat filtering and limiting similarity. 4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that soil resource availability is a crucial determinant of habitat filtering in this species-rich tropical rain forest; the strengths of assembly processes differed among soil types. Variation in soil resource availability can shape the distribution of traits through community assembly processes, promoting trait diversification and species coexistence.},

There is, however, no consensus regarding the choice of analytical methods. We contrast species- and community-level analyses of change in the functional composition for four traits related to drought tolerance using three decades of repeat censuses of trees in the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Community trait distributions shifted significantly through time, which may indicate a shift toward more drought tolerant species. However, at the species level, changes in abundance were unrelated to trait values. To reconcile these seemingly contrasting results, we evaluated species-specific contributions to the directional shifts observed at the community level. Abundance changes of just one to six of 312 species were responsible for the community-level shifts observed for each trait. Our results demonstrate that directional changes in community-level functional composition can result from idiosyncratic change in a few species rather than widespread community-wide changes associated with functional traits. Future analyses of directional change in natural communities should combine community-, species-, and possibly individual-level analyses to uncover relationships with function that can improve understanding and enable prediction.},

Assuming foraging performance to be the central link between metabolic rate and pace of life, we modeled the behavior of biological units with different metabolic rate, as foraging groups with or without within-group variation in metabolic rate, in environments of various resource configurations, with or without group-level behaviors such as information sharing and division of labor. Our results show how metabolic rate can interact with the resource environment to produce differences in energy gain and lifespan. The results also suggest that in a group context, rather than the average metabolic rate of the group, it is the composition of the group that matters such that metabolically diverse groups outperform metabolically homogenous groups. With a proposed experimental approach to test these predictions, these findings bring new insights to possible gene environment interactions that may be involved in the evolution of intraspecific differences in metabolic rates and how metabolic diversity may contribute to the evolution of group living.},

  abstract = {1 Using a sample of 24 common deciduous angiosperm trees of the Eastern Deciduous Forest region of North America, we tested the hypothesis that leaf size variation across species can be interpreted in terms of a trade-off between individual leaf mass and the number of leaves produced. 2 The true nature of a resource allocation trade-off is detectable only if variation in the total amount of growth is accounted for. We controlled for this effect by measuring all of the components of annual growth associated with leaf production at the individual terminal shoot level. Hence, number of leaves produced was expressed as `leafing intensity', i.e. the number of leaves produced by newly emerged (current year's) shoots, divided by the total volume of these shoots. 3 Ninety per cent (r2 = 0.90) of the variation in mean individual leaf mass across species, spanning two orders of magnitude, could be accounted for by proportional variation in mean leafing intensity, i.e. representing an isometric trade-off, with a slope for log-transformed data that did not deviate significantly from -1.0. 4 We suggest that this isometric relationship may represent a generalized trade-off strategy for leaf deployment at the shoot level within temperate deciduous woody species. Following traditional interpretations, adaptation here may involve a fitness benefit associated with a particular leaf size. The present results also suggest an alternative, i.e. selection may instead favour high leafing intensity, with small leaf mass resulting not as a direct adaptation, but simply as a trade-off. 5 According to this `leafing intensity premium' hypothesis, the fitness benefits of higher leafing intensity are associated primarily with the fitness benefits of a larger pool of lateral meristems, because each leaf is usually associated with an axillary bud. This may in turn provide greater facility for wide phenotypic plasticity in the allocation of these meristems to vegetative vs. reproductive functions. This represents a plausible hypothesis, we suggest, in accounting for why most woody deciduous angiosperms, even some of the largest/tallest ones, have relatively small leaves.},

Intraspecific variation in growth models among sites was characterized by significantly different estimates of growth at low light.

For the deciduous species, mortality processes exhibited more variation among the sites than did growth. I found significant site differences in mortality as a function of recent growth for both sugar maple and white ash on the calcareous soils in comparison to the schist/gneiss soils in Connecticut. In general, the mortality functions at the Michigan and the upland Connecticut site were similar, and both differed from the Connecticut calcareous site. Community dynamics at each of the three sites were simulated with a model of forest dynamics called SORTIE, which incorporated observed differences in sapling mortality and growth functions among the sites. Using SORTIE, among\textemdash site differences in only juvenile survivorship and growth were sufficient to predict dominant species in the adult canopy, demonstrating the critical importance of sapling stages to community dynamics. If a species performs differently at a particular site, its interactions with other species at the site will also change, potentially contributing to further differences in community species composition. Changes in species' performance in response to different site conditions and the species' subsequent interactions are critical to understanding differences among the dynamics and compositions of these forest communities.},

For the deciduous species, mortality processes exhibited more variation among the sites than did growth. I found significant site differences in mortality as a function of recent growth for both sugar maple and white ash on the calcareous soils in comparison to the schist/gneiss soils in Connecticut. In general, the mortality functions at the Michigan and the upland Connecticut site were similar, and both differed from the Connecticut calcareous site. Community dynamics at each of the three sites were simulated with a model of forest dynamics called SORTIE, which incorporated observed differences in sapling mortality and growth functions among the sites. Using SORTIE, among\textemdash site differences in only juvenile survivorship and growth were sufficient to predict dominant species in the adult canopy, demonstrating the critical importance of sapling stages to community dynamics. If a species performs differently at a particular site, its interactions with other species at the site will also change, potentially contributing to further differences in community species composition. Changes in species' performance in response to different site conditions and the species' subsequent interactions are critical to understanding differences among the dynamics and compositions of these forest communities.},

  abstract = {Niche Theory is a central framework in ecology based on the recognition that most interactions between organisms are indirect, mediated by the biotic and abiotic dynamical environment these organisms live in. Despite its potential generality, the theory still mostly focuses on how resource\textendash consumer dynamics mediate competition in ecological communities. However, it is being increasingly recognized that positive interactions between organisms also play an important role in driving the structure and functioning of ecological communities, from plants to microbes. In this paper, we present a unified theory of the niche that applies to both positive and negative interactions between organisms, mediated by one or two environmental factors. We show that classical concepts such as niche differences and fundamental and realized niches can naturally be expanded to facilitative and mutualistic interactions. In addition, we introduce and formalize new general niche concepts that appear exclusively in the presence of positive interactions: (1) the Allee niche, a region of environmental conditions for which a species can persist but not invade from low densities and (2) niche facilitation, when the presence of a species expands the set of environmental conditions under which a second species can invade and/or persist. To show the broad applicability of this theory, we illustrate these concepts using a diverse set of theoretical examples, from bacteria feeding on an inhibiting substrate, to nitrogen-fixing plants and the indirect mutualism between a plant and a carnivore species. In sum, our work shows how Niche Theory provides a natural framework for positive interactions in ecology, bringing a unified perspective and new conceptual tools to study ecological systems where these positive interactions occur.},

In mitigating pandemic influenza, effective allocation of limited health resources also plays a critical role along with effective use of medical prevention and treatment procedures. A national resource allocation program for prevention and treatment must be supported with the right allocation decisions for all regions and population risk groups. In this study, we develop a multi-objective mathematical programming model for optimal resource allocation decisions in a country where a serious risk of pandemic influenza may exist. These resources include monetary budget for antivirals and preventive vaccinations, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and nonIntensive Care Unit (non-ICU) beds. The mathematical model has three objectives: minimization of number of deaths, number of cases and total morbidity days during a pandemic influenza. This model can be used as a decision support tool by decision makers to assess the impact of different scenarios such as attack rates, hospitalization and death ratios. These factors are found to be very influential on the allocation of the total budget among preventive vaccination, antiviral treatment and fixed resources. The data set collected from various sources for Turkey is used and analyzed in detail as a case study.},

  abstract = {The composition of vegetation on a slope frequently changes substantially owing to the different micro-environments of various slope aspects. To understand how the slope aspect affects the vegetation changes, we examined the variations in leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf size (LS) within and among populations for 66 species from 14 plots with a variety of slope aspects in a subalpine meadow. LMA is a leaf economic trait that is tightly correlated with plant physiological traits, while the LS shows a tight correlation with leaf temperature, indicating the strategy of plants to self-adjust in different thermal and hydraulic conditions. In this study, we compared the two leaf traits between slope aspects and between functional types and explored their correlation with soil variables and heat load. Our results showed that high-LMA, small-leaved species were favored in south-facing slopes, while the reverse was true in north-facing areas. In detail, small dense-leaved graminoids dominated the south slopes, while large thin-leaved forbs dominated the north slopes. Soil moisture and the availability of soil P were the two most important soil factors that related to both LMA and LS, and heat load also contributed substantially. Moreover, we disentangled the relative importance of intraspecific trait variation and species turnover in the trait variation among plots and found that the intraspecific variation contributed 98\% and 56\% to LMA and LS variation among communities, respectively, implying a large contribution of intraspecific trait plasticity. These results indicate that LMA and LS are two essential leaf traits that affect the adaptation or acclimation of plants underlying the vegetation composition changes in different slope aspects in the subalpine meadow.},

  abstract = {Premise The phenomenon called ``diminishing returns'' refers to a scaling relationship between lamina mass (M) vs. lamina area (A) in many species, i.e., M {$\propto$} A{$\alpha>$}1, where {$\alpha$} is the scaling exponent exceeding unity. Prior studies have focused on the scaling relationships between lamina dry mass (DM) and A, or between fresh mass (FM) and A. However, the scaling between petiole mass and M and A has seldom been investigated. Here, we examine the scaling relationships among FM, DM, A, and petiole fresh mass (PFM). Methods For each of 3268 leaves from nine Lauraceae species, FM, DM, A, and PFM were measured, and their scaling relationships were fitted using reduced major axis regression protocols. The bootstrap percentile method was used to test the significance of the difference in {$\alpha$}-values between any two species. Results The phenomenon of diminishing returns was verified between FM vs. A and DM vs. A. The FM vs. A scaling relationship was statistically more robust than the DM vs. A scaling relationship based on bivariate regression r2-values. Diminishing returns were also observed for the PFM vs. FM and PFM vs. A scaling relationships. The PFM vs. FM scaling relationship was statistically more robust than the PFM vs. A scaling relationship. Conclusions ``Diminishing returns'' was confirmed among the FM, DM, A, and PFM scaling relationships. The data collectively indicate that the petiole scales mechanically more strongly with lamina mass than with area, suggesting that static (self) loading takes precedence over dynamic (wind) loading.},

Despite evidence of sufficient light brightness inducing plant physiology and affecting phenology, generalization regarding effects of light pollution on plant phenology across species and locations is less clear. Meanwhile, the relative contributions and joint effects of artificial light pollution and climate change or other anthropic stressors still remain unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized in situ plant phenological observations of seven tree species during 1991\textendash 2015 in Europe, night-time light dataset and gridded temperature dataset to investigate the impacts of the artificial light pollution on spatial-temporal shifts of plant phenological phases under climatic warming. We found 70\% of the observation sites were exposed to increased light pollution during 1992\textendash 2015. Among them, plant phenological phases substantially delayed at 12\textendash 39\% observation sites of leaf-out, and 6\textendash 53\% of flowering. We also found plant species appeared to be more sensitive to artificial light pollution, and phenology advancement was hindered more prominently and even delay phenomenon exhibited when the color level showed stronger sky brightness. Linear mixed models indicate that although temperature plays a dominant role in shifts of plant phenological phases at the spatial scale, the inhibitory effect of artificial light pollution is evident considering the interactions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantitatively establish the relationship between artificial light pollution and plant phenology across species and locations. Meanwhile, these findings provide a new insight into the ecological responses of plant phenology to the potential but poorly understood environmental stressors under this warmer world and call for light pollution to be accorded the equal status as other global change phenomena.},

Reproduction uses energy from reserves. The model describes both feeding and non-feeding stages, and hence is applicable to embryos (which neither feed nor reproduce), juveniles (which feed but do not reproduce), and adults (which commonly both feed and reproduce). Embryonic growth can have two forms depending on the assumptions for acquisition of energy from yolk. By default, when the energy acquisition rate exceeds the maintenance rate, a fixed proportion of the resulting net production is spent on growth (increase in structural biomass), and the remaining portion is channelled to the reserves. Feeding organisms, however, modulate their allocation of net production energy in response to their total energy content (energy in the reserves plus energy bounded to structural biomass). In variable food environment an organism alternates between periods of growth, no-growth, and balanced-growth. In the latter case the organism adopts an allocation strategy that keeps its total energy constant. Under constant environmental conditions, the growth of a juvenile is always of von Bertalanffy type. Depending on the values of model parameters there are two long-time possibilities for adults: (a) von Bertalanffy growth accompanied by reproduction at a rate that approaches zero as the organism approaches asymptotic size, or (b) abrupt cessation of growth at some finite time, following which, the rate of reproduction is constant. We illustrate the model's applicability in life history theory by studying the optimum values of the energy allocation parameters for constant environment and for each of the dynamic regimes described above.},

  abstract = {We formulate a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model for the growth and reproduction of individual organisms based on partitioning of net production (i.e. energy acquisition rate minus maintenance rate) between growth and energy reserves. Reproduction uses energy from reserves. The model describes both feeding and non-feeding stages, and hence is applicable to embryos (which neither feed nor reproduce), juveniles (which feed but do not reproduce), and adults (which commonly both feed and reproduce). Embryonic growth can have two forms depending on the assumptions for acquisition of energy from yolk. By default, when the energy acquisition rate exceeds the maintenance rate, a fixed proportion of the resulting net production is spent on growth (increase in structural biomass), and the remaining portion is channelled to the reserves. Feeding organisms, however, modulate their allocation of net production energy in response to their total energy content (energy in the reserves plus energy bounded to structural biomass). In variable food environment an organism alternates between periods of growth, no-growth, and balanced-growth. In the latter case the organism adopts an allocation strategy that keeps its total energy constant. Under constant environmental conditions, the growth of a juvenile is always of von Bertalanffy type. Depending on the values of model parameters there are two long-time possibilities for adults: (a) von Bertalanffy growth accompanied by reproduction at a rate that approaches zero as the organism approaches asymptotic size, or (b) abrupt cessation of growth at some finite time, following which, the rate of reproduction is constant.

  abstract = {The standard Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model assumes that assimilates of an isomorphic individual are first added to reserve, a fraction {$\kappa$} of mobilised reserve is allocated to soma (somatic maintenance plus growth of structure), and the rest to maturity maintenance and maturation or reproduction. Food, reserve and structure have constant chemical composition. We here discuss all possible topological alternatives to the standard DEB model, and compare them on the basis of seven properties: the ability to capture weak homeostasis and general empirical growth and reproduction patterns. We selected a reserve dynamics such that reserve mobilisation rate is independent of assimilation, somatic maintenance is proportional to the amount of structure, maturity maintenance to the level of maturity, and assimilation to the surface area. The alternatives only differ from the standard DEB model in topology, but we drop the {$\kappa$}-rule and allow {$\kappa$} to vary with the amount of structure. For this purpose we introduce the concept `generalised von Bertalanffy growth rate' and study how it behaves as a function of the ultimate structural length, both intra- and inter-specifically. The 21 derived topological alternatives of the standard DEB are classified into five classes of models, depending on the first allocation event for the assimilation flux. The possibilities of the first allocation event for the assimilation flux are: splitting ({$\kappa$}-models), storing (A-models), both maintenance fluxes simultaneously (P-models), somatic maintenance (S-models) or maturity maintenance (J-models). We conclude that the standard DEB model with constant {$\kappa$} is the only one that passes all our tests successfully. Only assimilation (A) models can naturally accommodate embryo development. The {$\kappa$}-models, which after splitting the fraction 1-{$\kappa$} of assimilates is allocated to maturity maintenance and maturity/reproduction while the fraction {$\kappa$} of assimilates is first stored in reserve or allocated to somatic maintenance, pass most tests, but have maturation and reproduction directly from food. So, embryos have to do this differently and reproduction is prohibited during starvation in these models.},

  abstract = {Many animals must often respond to environmental patterns that simulatneously influence both foraging efficiency and predation risk. We noted that grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) sometimes immediately consume food items in areas of relatively great exposure to predators, and at other times carry food items to the safety of a tree prior to consumption. We outlined a hypothesis that the squirrels were somehow trading-off energy intake rate against predation risk. A simple model shows that maximal energetic efficiency is associated with immediate consumption, whereas (under the field conditions studied) carrying items to the safety of trees provides for minimal exposure to predation. Our analysis of the model predicts that the tendency to carry a food item should decrease with distance of food from cover (travel time) and increase with item size (handling time). To test our predictions, we presented free-roaming grey squirrels with patches containing a fixed number of identical food items. We estimated the proportion of items carried to trees before consumption for 12 different combinations of distance to the nearest tree and item size. The results support our hypothesis and indicate that a simple behavioural criterion based solely on foraging rate or time exposed to predators is insufficient to explain the variation in the data.},

The competition-defence hypothesis posits a trade-off between competitive ability and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The growth-defence hypothesis suggests that strong competitors for nutrients are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500 species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance in species responses to both treatments provided support for a growth-defence trade-off: populations that increased with the removal of nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal of consumers. This result held globally across 4 years within plant life-history groups and within the majority of individual sites. Thus, a growth-defence trade-off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms maintaining grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.},

Although numerous studies have tested its potential biological and ecological impacts on animals, very few studies have tested whether it affects alien and native plants differently. Furthermore, common plant species, and particularly common alien species, are often found to benefit more from additional resources than rare native and rare alien species. Whether this is also the case with regard to increasing light due to ALAN is still unknown. Here, we tested how ALAN affected the performance of common and rare alien and native plant species in Germany directly, and indirectly via flying insects. We grew five common alien, six rare alien, five common native, and four rare native plant species under four combinations of two ALAN (no ALAN vs. ALAN) and two insect-exclusion (no exclusion vs. exclusion) treatments, and compared their biomass production. We found that common plant species, irrespective of their origin, produced significantly more biomass than rare species and that this was particularly true under ALAN. Furthermore, alien species tended to show a slightly stronger positive response to ALAN than native species did (p = .079). Our study shows that common plant species benefited more from ALAN than rare ones. This might lead to competitive exclusion of rare species, which could have cascading impacts on other trophic levels and thus have important community-wide consequences when ALAN becomes more widespread. In addition, the slightly more positive response of alien species indicates that ALAN might increase the risk of alien plant invasions.},

It is proposed that tree life-history traits are adaptations to particular disturbance regimes. Four independent axes are proposed to define the dominant dimensions of tree strategy space: shade tolerance, tree height, capacity for vegetative reproduction, and seed dispersal distance. A fitness model was developed to elucidate interactions between the proposed life-history traits. The model shows how alternate life-history sets can coexist when disturbance patterns fluctuate in space and time. Variable disturbance regimes were shown, based on data and simulation results, to enhance species coexistence, as predicted. The strategy space model accurately predicts the number of common tree species for the eastern United States, boreal Canada, and southwestern pi\~non-juniper woodlands. The model also provides an explanation for latitudinal gradients in tree species richness in North America and Europe. The proposed model predicts a relationship between disturbance characteristics and the species composition of a forest that allows for the coexistence of large numbers of species. The life-history traits of size, growth rate, life span, shade tolerance, age of reproduction, seed dispersal distance, and vegetative reproduction are all incorporated into the model.},

Some of the catastrophic consequences of light for certain taxonomic groups are well known, such as the deaths of migratory birds around tall lighted structures, and those of hatchling sea turtles disoriented by lights on their natal beaches. The more subtle influences of artificial night lighting on the behavior and community ecology of species are less well recognized, and constitute a new focus for research in ecology and a pressing conservation challenge.},

However, no current U.S. estimates are based on systematic analysis of multiple data sources. We reviewed the published literature and acquired unpublished datasets to systematically quantify bird\textendash building collision mortality and species-specific vulnerability. Based on 23 studies, we estimate that between 365 and 988 million birds (median {$\frac{1}{4}$} 599 million) are killed annually by building collisions in the U.S., with roughly 56\% of mortality at low-rises, 44\% at residences, and ,1\% at high-rises. Based on .92,000 fatality records, and after controlling for population abundance and range overlap with study sites, we identified several species that are disproportionately vulnerable to collisions at all building types. In addition, several species listed as national Birds of Conservation Concern due to their declining populations were identified to be highly vulnerable to building collisions, including Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera), Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris), Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum). The identification of these five migratory species with geographic ranges limited to eastern and central North America reflects seasonal and regional biases in the currently available building-collision data. Most sampling has occurred during migration and in the eastern U.S. Further research across seasons and in underrepresented regions is needed to reduce this bias. Nonetheless, we provide quantitative evidence to support the conclusion that building collisions are second only to feral and free-ranging pet cats, which are estimated to kill roughly four times as many birds each year, as the largest source of direct human-caused mortality for U.S. birds.},

The `whole-plant compensation point', interpolated from stem growth measurements across a wide range of light environments, has been proposed as a simple, robust measure of species shade tolerance. Others have argued that shade tolerance is primarily a function of differential ability to survive periods of slow growth (`suppression'), implying that measurements of survival are vital. We measured growth of juveniles (500\textendash 1000 mm tall) of five evergreen trees over 12 months in a cool-temperate rain forest in New Zealand, to determine whether whole-plant compensation points predicted species differences in occupancy of understorey light environments, which were quantified using hemispherical photography. The five species encompassed 3{$\cdot$}5-fold variation in whole-plant compensation points. Compensation points of most species fell within the first quartile of the distribution of light environments occupied by juveniles; they were also correlated with low-light mortality rates of juveniles, estimated from permanent plot data archived in the National Vegetation Survey Databank. Compensation points were also significantly positively correlated with height growth rates in high light, confirming the presence of the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off detected in many other forest tree assemblages. Results show that, in temperate evergreen forests, the whole-plant compensation point distinguishes reliably between species of differing shade tolerance. Excepting situations involving parameterization of demographic models, shade tolerance can therefore be assessed without survival measurements. However, estimating whole-plant compensation points may prove more difficult in deciduous forests, where seasonal variation in understorey light transmission poses additional challenges.},

We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions.

  abstract = {Artificial night lighting threatens to disrupt strongly conserved light-dependent processes in animals and may have cascading effects on ecosystems as species interactions become altered. Insectivorous bats and their prey have been involved in a nocturnal, co-evolutionary arms race for millions of years. Lights may interfere with anti-bat defensive behaviours in moths, and disrupt a complex and globally ubiquitous interaction between bats and insects, ultimately leading to detrimental consequences for ecosystems on a global scale. We combined experimental and mathematical approaches to determine effects of light pollution on a free-living bat\textendash insect community. We compared prey selection by Cape serotine bats Neoromicia capensis in naturally unlit and artificially lit conditions using a manipulative field experiment, and developed a probabilistic model based on a suite of prey-selection factors to explain differences in observed diet. Moth consumption by N. capensis was low under unlit conditions (mean percentage volume {$\pm$} SD: 5{$\cdot$}91 {$\pm$} 6{$\cdot$}25\%), while moth consumption increased sixfold (mean percentage volume {$\pm$} SD: 35{$\cdot$}42 {$\pm$} 17{$\cdot$}90\%) under lit conditions despite a decrease in relative moth abundance. Predictive prey-selection models that included high-efficacy estimates for eared-moth defensive behaviour found most support given diet data for bats in unlit conditions. Conversely, models that estimated eared-moth defensive behaviour as absent or low found more support given diet data for bats in lit conditions. Our models therefore suggest the increase in moth consumption was a result of light-induced, decreased eared-moth defensive behaviour. Policy implications. In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth-eating bats and eared moths will face ever-increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively. Lights should be developed to be less attractive to moths, with the goal of reducing effects on moth behaviour. Unfortunately, market preference for broad-spectrum lighting and possible effects on other taxa make development of moth-friendly lighting improbable. Mitigation should therefore focus on the reduction of temporal, spatial and luminance redundancy in outdoor lighting. Restriction of light inside nature reserves and urban greenbelts can help maintain dark refugia for moth-eating bats and moths, and may become important for their persistence.},

  abstract = {Polar bear (Ursus maritimus) populations are predicted to be negatively affected by climate warming, but the timeframe and manner in which change to polar bear populations will occur remains unclear. Predictions incorporating climate change effects are necessary for proactive population management, the setting of optimal harvest quotas, and conservation status decisions. Such predictions are difficult to obtain from historic data directly because past and predicted environmental conditions differ substantially. Here, we explore how models can be used to predict polar bear population responses under climate change. We suggest the development of mechanistic models aimed at predicting reproduction and survival as a function of the environment. Such models can often be developed, parameterized, and tested under current environmental conditions. Model predictions for reproduction and survival under future conditions could then be input into demographic projection models to improve abundance predictions under climate change. We illustrate the approach using two examples. First, using an individual-based dynamic energy budget model, we estimate that 3\textendash 6\% of adult males in Western Hudson Bay would die of starvation before the end of a 120day summer fasting period but 28\textendash 48\% would die if climate warming increases the fasting period to 180days. Expected changes in survival are non-linear (sigmoid) as a function of fasting period length. Second, we use an encounter rate model to predict changes in female mating probability under sea ice area declines and declines in mate-searching efficiency due to habitat fragmentation. The model predicts that mating success will decline non-linearly if searching efficiency declines faster than habitat area, and increase non-linearly otherwise. Specifically for the Lancaster Sound population, we predict that female mating success would decline from 99\% to 91\% if searching efficiency declined twice as fast as sea ice area, and to 72\% if searching efficiency declined four times as fast as area. Sea ice is a complex and dynamic habitat that is rapidly changing. Failure to incorporate climate change effects into population projections can result in flawed conservation assessments and management decisions.},

Ecologists most often explain G\textendash D tradeoffs through principles of economic optimality, in which negative trait correlations are attributed to the reconciliation of fitness costs. Recently, researchers in molecular biology have developed `big data' resources including multi-omic (e.g. transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) studies that describe the cellular processes controlling gene expression in model species. In this synthesis, we bridge ecological theory with discoveries in multi-omics biology to better understand how selection has shaped the mechanisms of G\textendash D tradeoffs. Multi-omic studies reveal strategically coordinated patterns in resource allocation that are enabled by phytohormone crosstalk and transcriptional signal cascades. Coordinated resource allocation justifies the framework of optimality theory, while providing mechanistic insight into the feedbacks and control hubs that calibrate G\textendash D tradeoff commitments. We use the existing literature to describe the coordinated resource allocation hypothesis (CoRAH) that accounts for balanced cellular controls during the expression of G\textendash D tradeoffs, while sustaining stored resource pools to buffer the impacts of future stresses. The integrative mechanisms of the CoRAH unify the supply- and demand-side perspectives of previous G\textendash D tradeoff theories.},

Hard leaves with high mass per unit area (LMA) occur more frequently in water- and nutrient-limited habitats, where stress-tolerance is key to survival. Coordination between leaf mechanical properties and drought tolerance can arise because some (but not all) of the anatomical modifications leading to high LMA are mechanistically correlated to physiological traits conferring tolerance to dehydration. Thick cell walls are frequently coupled with low turgor loss point values, and also prevent cell shrinkage and collapse after turgor loss has occurred. This also protects the leaf against shrinking-induced loss of water transport capacity in the extra-vascular pathway. In turn, vascular water transport in the leaf veins is at risk of embolism-induced disruption under drought, but higher length of major veins per unit area can provide alternative pathways for water delivery to the mesophyll, while contributing to increased leaf stiffness. Water shortage in dry and warm habitats implies the risk of reduced photosynthetic rates, apparently favouring species that produce hard and drought-tolerant leaves, to warrant long leaf life span and to maintain gas exchange and positive carbon gain when conditions become harsh.},

This analysis is based on a Kolmogorov-type canopy partitioning model for plant species with clonal growth form and fixed vertical leaf profiles (Vance and Nevai in J. Theor. Biol., 2007, to appear). We show that canopy partitioning is necessary for the stable coexistence of the two competing plant species. We also use implicit methods to show that, under certain conditions, the species' nullclines can intersect at most once. We use nullcline endpoint analysis to show that when the nullclines do intersect, and in such a way that they cross, then the resulting equilibrium point is always stable. We also construct surfaces that divide parameter space into regions within which the various outcomes of competition occur, and then study parameter dependence in the locations of these surfaces. The analysis presented here and in a companion paper (Nevai and Vance, The role of leaf height in plant competition for sunlight: analysis of a canopy partitioning model, in review) together shows that canopy partitioning is both necessary and, under appropriate parameter values, sufficient for the stable coexistence of two hypothetical plant species whose structure and growth are described by our model.},

  abstract = {The present study was undertaken to test for the hypothesis that the rate of development in the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport per unit area (Jmax;A), and maximum carboxylase activity of Rubisco (Vcmax;A) is proportional to average integrated daily quantum flux density (Qint) in a mixed deciduous forest dominated by the shade-intolerant species Populus tremula L., and the shade-tolerant species Tilia cordata Mill. We distinguished between the age-dependent changes in net assimilation rates due to modifications in leaf dry mass per unit area (MA), foliar nitrogen content per unit dry mass (NM), and fractional partitioning of foliar nitrogen in the proteins of photosynthetic electron transport (FB), Rubisco (FR) and in light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complexes (Vcmax;A {$\propto$} MANMFR; Jmax;A {$\propto$} MANMFB). In both species, increases in Jmax;A and Vcmax;A during leaf development were primarily determined by nitrogen allocation to growing leaves, increases in leaf nitrogen partitioning in photosynthetic machinery, and increases in MA. Canopy differences in the rate of development of leaf photosynthetic capacity were mainly controlled by the rate of change in MA. There was only small within-canopy variation in the initial rate of biomass accumulation per unit Qint (slope of MA versus leaf age relationship per unit Qint), suggesting that canopy differences in the rate of development of Jmax;A and Vcmax;A are directly proportional to Qint. Nevertheless, MA, nitrogen, Jmax;A and Vcmax;A of mature leaves were not proportional to Qint because of a finite MA in leaves immediately after bud-burst (light-independent component of MA). MA, leaf chlorophyll contents and chlorophyll : N ratio of mature leaves were best correlated with the integrated average quantum flux density during leaf development, suggesting that foliar photosynthetic apparatus, once developed, is not affected by day-to-day fluctuations in Qint. However, for the upper canopy leaves of P. tremula and for the entire canopy of T. cordata, there was a continuous decline in N contents per unit dry mass in mature non-senescent leaves on the order of 15\textendash 20\% for a change of leaf age from 40 to 120 d, possibly manifesting nitrogen reallocation to bud formation. The decline in N contents led to similar decreases in leaf photosynthetic capacity and foliar chlorophyll contents. These data demonstrate that light-dependent variation in the rate of developmental changes in MA determines canopy differences in photosynthetic capacity, whereas foliar photosynthetic apparatus is essentially constant in fully developed leaves.},

  abstract = {Plant canopies are characterized by dramatic gradients of light between canopy top and bottom, and interactions between light, temperature and water vapour deficits. This review summarizes current knowledge of potentials and limitations of acclimation of foliage photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and light-harvesting efficiency to complex environmental gradients within the canopies. Acclimation of Amax to high light availability involves accumulation of rate-limiting photosynthetic proteins per unit leaf area as the result of increases in leaf thickness in broad-leaved species and volume : total area ratio and mesophyll thickness in species with complex geometry of leaf cross-section. Enhancement of light-harvesting efficiency in low light occurs through increased chlorophyll production per unit dry mass, greater leaf area per unit dry mass investment in leaves and shoot architectural modifications that improve leaf exposure and reduce within-shoot shading. All these acclimation responses vary among species, resulting in species-specific use efficiencies of low and high light. In fast-growing canopies and in evergreen species, where foliage developed and acclimated to a certain light environment becomes shaded by newly developing foliage, leaf senescence, age-dependent changes in cell wall characteristics and limited foliage re-acclimation capacity can constrain adjustment of older leaves to modified light availabilities. The review further demonstrates that leaves in different canopy positions respond differently to dynamic fluctuations in light availability and to multiple environmental stresses. Foliage acclimated to high irradiance respond more plastically to rapid changes in leaf light environment, and is more resistant to co-occurring heat and water stress. However, in higher light, co-occurring stresses can more strongly curb the efficiency of foliage photosynthetic machinery through reductions in internal diffusion conductance to CO2. This review demonstrates strong foliage potential for acclimation to within-canopy environmental gradients, but also highlights complex constraints on acclimation and foliage functioning resulting from light \texttimes{} foliage age interactions, multiple environmental stresses, dynamic light fluctuations and species-specific leaf and shoot structural constraints.},

We approach this question pragmatically\textemdash through detailed study of the individual physiology and population dynamics of the zooplankter Daphnia and its algal food. Standard DEB theory uses several state variables to characterize the state of an individual organism, thereby making the transition to population dynamics technically challenging, while ecologists demand maximally simple models that can be used in multi-scale modelling. We demonstrate that simpler representations of individual bioenergetics with a single state variable (size), and two life stages (juveniles and adults), contain sufficient detail on mass and energy budgets to yield good fits to data on growth, maturation and reproduction of individual Daphnia in response to food availability. The same simple representations of bioenergetics describe some features of Daphnia mortality, including enhanced mortality at low food that is not explicitly incorporated in the standard DEB model. Size-structured, population models incorporating this additional mortality component resolve some long-standing questions on stability and population cycles in Daphnia. We conclude that a bioenergetic model serving solely as a `regression' connecting organismal performance to the history of its environment can rest on simpler representations than those of standard DEB. But there are associated costs with such pragmatism, notably loss of connection to theory describing interspecific variation in physiological rates. The latter is an important issue, as the type of detailed study reported here can only be performed for a handful of species.},

Despite some exceptions, case studies, examined by trade-offs between reproduction and other life-history traits, generally support the predictions of the cost of reproduction hypothesis. The cost of reproduction as an evolutionary determinant of sexual dimorphism in life history traits in dioecious species was specifically tested, considering that the higher cost of reproduction in females has driven the life history traits related to sexual dimorphism. Females of woody dioecious species were consistently smaller than males supporting the costs of reproduction hypothesis. By contrast, females of herbaceous perennials were generally the larger sex, which did not fit the expectations of the hypothesis. Finally, the mechanisms that enable the compensation of the reproductive costs are detailed, including the plastic responses of photosynthesis and growth, the effects of the timing of investment, plant architecture and plant physiological integration.

Although broad trade-offs among leaf structural and physiological traits have been demonstrated, we still do not have a comprehensive view of the fundamental constraints underlying the LES trade-offs. Here, we investigated physiological and structural mechanisms underpinning the LES by analysing a novel data compilation incorporating rarely considered traits such as the dry mass fraction in cell walls, nitrogen allocation, mesophyll CO2 diffusion and associated anatomical traits for hundreds of species covering major growth forms. The analysis demonstrates that cell wall constituents are major components of leaf dry mass (18\textendash 70\%), especially in leaves with high leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and long lifespan. A greater fraction of leaf mass in cell walls is typically associated with a lower fraction of leaf nitrogen (N) invested in photosynthetic proteins; and lower within-leaf CO2 diffusion rates, as a result of thicker mesophyll cell walls. The costs associated with greater investments in cell walls underpin the LES: long leaf lifespans are achieved via higher LMA and in turn by higher cell wall mass fraction, but this inevitably reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis.},

Long-term records show that insect abundance has declined significantly over this time, with worrying implications for terrestrial ecosystems. The majority of investigations into the vulnerability of nocturnal insects to artificial light have focused on the flight-to-light behavior exhibited by select insect families. However, ALAN can affect insects in other ways as well. This review proposes five categories of ALAN impact on nocturnal insects, highlighting past research and identifying key knowledge gaps. We conclude with a summary of relevant literature on bioluminescent fireflies, which emphasizes the unique vulnerability of terrestrial light-based communication systems to artificial illumination. Comprehensive understanding of the ecological impacts of ALAN on diverse nocturnal insect taxa will enable researchers to seek out methods whereby fireflies, moths, and other essential members of the nocturnal ecosystem can coexist with humans on an increasingly urbanized planet.},

  abstract = {Light is a crucial environmental cue not only for photosynthetic energy production but also for plant growth and development. Plants employ sophisticated methods to detect and interpret information from incoming light. Five classes of photoreceptors have been discovered in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These photoreceptors act either distinctly and/or redundantly in fine-tuning many aspects of plant life cycle. Unlike mobile animals, sessile plants have developed an enormous plasticity to adapt and survive in changing environment. By monitoring different information arising from ambient light, plants precisely regulate downstream signaling pathways to adapt accordingly. Given that changes in the light environment is typically synchronized with other environmental cues such as temperature, abiotic stresses, and seasonal changes, it is not surprising that light signaling pathways are interconnected with multiple pathways to regulate plant physiology and development. Indeed, recent advances in plant photobiology revealed a large network of co-regulation among different photoreceptor signaling pathways as well as other internal signaling pathways (e.g., hormone signaling). In addition, some photoreceptors are directly involved in perception of non-light stimuli (e.g., temperature). Therefore, understanding highly inter-connected signaling networks is essential to explore the photoreceptor functions in plants. Here, we summarize how plants co-ordinate multiple photoreceptors and their internal signaling pathways to regulate a myriad of downstream responses at molecular and physiological levels.},

Based on an evaluation of ecological carrying capacity (ECC), we have constructed a three-dimensional trade-off model for socially harmonious development for the Sichuan and Yunnan regions in southwest China. The results demonstrate that there is a continuous increase in socioeconomic coordination (SEC; slope {$>$} 0.23) and a change in the ECC in the study area, characterized by subtle fluctuations from 2000 through 2008. This was primarily due to the loss of resource and environment carrying capacity wiping out the profits of SEC. Significant government aid during the postdisaster reconstruction and more attention being paid to the environment in policy resulted in a faster increase in ECC (slope {$>$} 0.38) from 2008 to 2016. Based on this trade-off model, managers could deeply understand the relationship between resources, the economy, and ecology. Summary for Managers Ecological environment protection is increasingly crucial in Sichuan and Yunnan regions as they feel the effects of climate change and human activities. The three-dimensional trade-off model measuring socially coordinated development is a modified multiobjective, decision-making model. Based on this trade-off model, managers could, understand the relationship between resources, the economy, and ecology. It can help manage our environmental assets and plan ecological conservation, to ensure that the environment maintains its capacity to serve the societal development.},

  abstract = {The choice of the best sampling strategy to capture mean values of functional traits for a species/population, while maintaining information about traits' variability and minimizing the sampling size and effort, is an open issue in functional trait ecology. Intraspecific variability (ITV) of functional traits strongly influences sampling size and effort. However, while adequate information is available about intraspecific variability between individuals (ITVBI) and among populations (ITVPOP), relatively few studies have analyzed intraspecific variability within individuals (ITVWI). Here, we provide an analysis of ITVWI of two foliar traits, namely specific leaf area (SLA) and osmotic potential ({$\pi$}), in a population of Quercus ilex L. We assessed the baseline ITVWI level of variation between the two traits and provided the minimum and optimal sampling size in order to take into account ITVWI, comparing sampling optimization outputs with those previously proposed in the literature. Different factors accounted for different amount of variance of the two traits. SLA variance was mostly spread within individuals (43.4\% of the total variance), while {$\pi$} variance was mainly spread between individuals (43.2\%). Strategies that did not account for all the canopy strata produced mean values not representative of the sampled population. The minimum size to adequately capture the studied functional traits corresponded to 5 leaves taken randomly from 5 individuals, while the most accurate and feasible sampling size was 4 leaves taken randomly from 10 individuals. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of the canopy could significantly affect traits variability. Moreover, different strategies for different traits could be implemented during sampling surveys. We partially confirm sampling sizes previously proposed in the recent literature and encourage future analysis involving different traits.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests are the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems and home to numerous tree species competing for resources in space and time. Functional traits influence the ecophysiological performance of tree species, yet the relationship between traits and emergent long-term growth patterns is poorly understood. Here, we present a novel 3D forest stand model in which growth patterns of individual trees and forest stands are emergent properties of leaf traits. Individual trees are simulated as 3D functional-structural tree models (FSTMs), considering branches up to the second order and leaf dynamics at a resolution of one cubic meter. Each species is characterized by a set of leaf traits that corresponds to a specific position on the leaf economics spectrum and determines light-driven carbon assimilation, respiration and mortality rates. Applying principles of the pipe model theory, these leaf scale processes are coupled with within-tree carbon allocation, i.e., 3D tree growth emerges from low-level processes. By integrating these FSTMs into a dynamic forest stand model, we go beyond modern stand models to integrate structurally detailed internal physiological processes with interspecific competition and interactions with the environment in diverse tree communities. For model calibration and validation, we simultaneously compared a large number of emergent patterns at both the tree and forest levels in a pattern-oriented modelling framework. At the tree level, the specific leaf area and correlated leaf traits determined the maximum height and age of trees, as well as their size-dependent growth rate and shade tolerance. Trait variations along the leaf economics spectrum led to a continuous transition from fast-growing, short-lived and shade-intolerant to slow-growing, long-lived and shade-tolerant trees. These emerging patterns resemble well-known functional tree types, indicating a fundamental impact of leaf traits on long-term growth patterns. At the forest level, a large number of patterns taken from lowland Neotropical forests were reproduced, indicating that our forest model simulates structurally realistic forests over long time spans. Our ecophysiological approach improves the understanding of how leaf level processes scale up to the tree and the stand level, and facilitates the development of next-generation forest models for species-rich forests in which tree performance emerges directly from functional traits.},

A split-plot experimental design was used with three replications. The LAIs calculated by the leaf disc and digital photo methods were compared at four growth stages in four soybean cultivars (subplot). These soybean cultivars were sowed in Guarapuava, Paran\'a State, Brazil, at three different sowing dates (main plot) in the 2010/2011 growing season. Regression analysis was used for each group of samples, and the efficiency of the leaf disc method was evaluated on the basis of the coefficient of determination (R{$^2$}), the calculated F and the intersection and abscissa errors. The regression analysis that compared the two methods resulted in highly significant F values and low errors for all sample groups, which showed the effectiveness of the leaf disc method. Although the R2 value was high for all of the analyses, the values were minor for the separate growth stage analysis, especially for the samples collected at the V9 and R2 stages. The results indicated that the specific leaf area calculated by the leaf disc method was lesser to the specific leaf area calculated by the digital photo method. The leaf disc method is an efficient and robust method for estimating the LAI of soybean plants.},

Here, we aim to understand the effects of leaf functional trait diversity on canopy light ab\- sorption. We focus on the diversity of three key functional traits that influence the light-canopy interaction: leaf area index (LAI), leaf angle distribution (LAD) and leaf optical properties (LOP). We used a 3D radiative transfer model to perform an in-silico biodiversity experiment to study the effects of leaf functional diversity on a light proxy for productivity (the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR)) and net radiation (shortwave albedo). We found that diverse canopies had lower albedo and higher FAPAR than the average of the corresponding monoculture values. In mixtures, FAPAR was unequally re-distributed between trees with distinct traits: some plant functional types absorbed more light and some plant functional types absorbed less than in monocultures. The net biodiversity effect on absorptance was greater when combining plant functional types with more distinct leaf traits. Our results support the mechanistic understanding of overyielding effects in functionally diverse canopies and may partially explain some of the growth-promoting mechanisms in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments. They can further help to account for biodiversity effects in climate models.},

  abstract = {Here, we analysed a wide range of literature data on the leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA). In nature, LMA varies more than 100-fold among species. Part of this variation (c. 35\%) can be ascribed to differences between functional groups, with evergreen species having the highest LMA, but most of the variation is within groups or biomes. When grown in the same controlled environment, leaf succulents and woody evergreen, perennial or slow-growing species have inherently high LMA. Within most of the functional groups studied, high-LMA species show higher leaf tissue densities. However, differences between evergreen and deciduous species result from larger volumes per area (thickness). Response curves constructed from experiments under controlled conditions showed that LMA varied strongly with light, temperature and submergence, moderately with CO2 concentration and nutrient and water stress, and marginally under most other conditions. Functional groups differed in the plasticity of LMA to these gradients. The physiological regulation is still unclear, but the consequences of variation in LMA and the suite of traits interconnected with it are strong. This trait complex is an important factor determining the fitness of species in their environment and affects various ecosystem processes. Contents Summary 565 I. LMA in perspective 566 II.

  abstract = {Evaluation of restoration activities is indispensable to assess the extent to which targets have been reached. Usually, the main goal of ecological restoration is to restore biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but validation is often based on a single indicator, which may or may not cope with whole-ecosystem dynamics. Network analyses are, however, powerful tools, allowing to examine both the recovery of various biotic and abiotic properties and the integrated response at community and ecosystem level. We used restoration sites where topsoil was removed from former intensively managed grassland and seeds were added. These sites were between 3 to 32 years old. We assessed how plants, soil biota, soil properties, and correlation-based interactions between biotic communities and their abiotic environment developed over time and compared the results with (i) intensively managed (not restored), and (ii) well-preserved targeted semi-natural grasslands. Plant, nematode, fungal, and prokaryotic diversity and community structures of the restored grasslands revealed clear successional patterns and followed similar trajectories towards targeted semi-natural grasslands. All biotic communities reached targeted diversity levels no later than 18 years post restoration. Ecological networks of intensively managed and short-term ( 4 years) restored grasslands were less tightly connected compared to those found in mid- and long-term ( 18-30 years) restored and target grasslands. Restoration specifically enhanced interactions among biotic communities, but reduced interactions between biotic communities and their abiotic environment as well as interactions among abiotic properties in the short- and mid-term. Synthesis and applications: Overall, our study demonstrated that topsoil removal and seed addition were successful in restoring diverse, tightly coupled and well-connected biotic communities above- and belowground similar to those found in the semi-natural grasslands that were restoration targets. Network analyses proved to be powerful in examining the long-term re-establishment of functionally connected biotic communities in restored ecosystems. Thus, we provide an approach to holistically assess restoration activities by notably considering the complexity of ecosystems, much in contrast to most traditional approaches.},

We determined LMA and its components (LD, LVA and anatomical tissues) for 34 Mediterranean (20 evergreen and 14 deciduous) woody species. Variation in LMA was due to variation in both LD and LVA. For both deciduous and evergreen species LVA variation was strongly and positively related with mesophyll volume per area (VA or thickness), but for evergreen species positive relationships of LVA with the VA of epidermis, vascular plus sclerenchyma tissues and air spaces were found as well. The leaf carbon concentration was positively related with mesophyll VA in deciduous species, and with VA of vascular plus sclerenchymatic tissues in evergreens.

Does habitat diversity support species diversity, or is it the other way around? What reduces diversity in ecologically productive places? At what scales of space and time do diversity patterns hold? Do the mechanisms that produce them vary with scale? This book examines these questions and many others, by employing both theory and data in the search for answers. Surprisingly, many of the questions have reasonably likely answers. By identifying these, attention can be turned toward life's many, still-unexplained diversity patterns. As evolutionary ecologists race to understand biodiversity before it is too late, this book will help set the agenda for diversity research into the next century.},

  abstract = {Leaf mass per area (M\^) is a central ecological trait that is intercorrelated with leaf life span, photosjnthetic rate, nutrient concentration, and palatability to herbivores. These coordinated variables form a globally convergent leaf economics spectrum, which represents a general continuum running from rapid resource acquisition to maximized resource retention. Leaf economics are little studied in ancient ecosystems because they cannot be directly measured from leaf fossils. Here we use a large extant data set (65 sites; 667 species-site pairs) to develop a new, easily measured scaling relationship between petiole width and leaf mass, normalized for leaf area; this enables M\^ estimation for fossil leaves from petiole width and leaf area, two variables that are commonly measurable in leaf compression floras. The calibration data are restricted to woody angiosperms exclusive of monocots, but a preliminary data set (25 species) suggests that broad-leaved gymnosperms exhibit a similar scaling. Application to two well-studied, classic Eocene floras demonstrates that M\^ can be quantified in fossil assemblages. First, our results are consistent with predictions from paleobotanical and paleoclimatic studies of these floras. We found exclusively low-M\^ species from Republic (Washington, U.S.A., 49 Ma), a humid, warm-temperate flora with a strong deciduous component among the angiosperms, and a wide M\^ range in a seasonally dry, warm-temperate flora from the Green River Formation at Bonanza (Utah, U.S.A, 47 Ma), presumed to comprise a mix of short and long leaf life spans. Second, reconstructed M\^ in the fossil species is negatively correlated with levels of insect herbivory, whether measured as the proportion of leaves with insect damage, the proportion of leaf area removed by herbivores, or the diversity of insect-damage morphotypes. These correlations are consistent with herbivory observations in extant floras and they reflect fundamental trade-offs in plant-herbivore associations. Our results indicate that several key aspects of plant and plant-animal ecology can now be quantified in the fossil record and demonstrate that herbivory has helped shape the evolution of leaf structure for millions of years.},

Interspecific relationships between fundamental demographic rates, often called demographic trade-offs, emerge from constraints within individuals related to morphology, physiology and resource allocation. Plant species that grow fast in high light usually have high mortality in shade, and this well-established relationship in part defines a species' successional niche. More generally, this relationship represents a trade-off between a species' ability to grow quickly to exploit abundant resources vs. avoiding mortality when resources are less plentiful, but few studies have described this demographic trade-off with respect to environmental factors other than light. 2. Using demographic data from 960 tree species in Bornean rain forest, we examined the evidence for an interspecific demographic trade-off between fast growth and low mortality and its variation among habitats defined by variation in soil fertility and moisture. Such a trade-off could contribute to sorting of tree species among habitats and partly explain the striking patterns of species' edaphic associations in this and other forests. 3. We found strong evidence for this demographic trade-off, both within the same habitat and when growth on edaphically rich habitats was compared with mortality on a habitat with lower below-ground resource availability. 4. The slope of the growth-mortality relationship varied among habitats, being steepest on the habitat lowest in below-ground resources. For species with the fastest potential growth rates, mortality was higher on this habitat than at comparable growth rates on the three more edaphically rich habitats, providing a possible mechanism by which fast-growing species may be eliminated from the poorest habitat. Adaptations for fast growth may entail a greater mortality risk, if inherently fast-growing species fail to maintain a positive C-balance when below-ground resources are scarce. 5. Conversely, for species with the slowest potential growth rates, the highest species' mortality rates occurred on the habitats with greatest below-ground resource availability, implying that slow-growing species may have a competitive disadvantage in resource-rich environments. 6.

Unavoidable trade-offs dictate that allocation to growth-promoting functions curtails other functions, generating a gradient of investment in growth versus survival along which tree species align, known as the interspecific growth\textendash mortality trade-off. This paradigm is widely accepted but not well established. Using demographic data for 1,111 tree species across ten tropical forests, we tested the generality of the growth\textendash mortality trade-off and evaluated its underlying drivers using two species-specific parameters describing resource allocation strategies: tolerance of resource limitation and responsiveness of allocation to resource access. Globally, a canonical growth\textendash mortality trade-off emerged, but the trade-off was strongly observed only in less disturbance-prone forests, which contained diverse resource allocation strategies. Only half of disturbance-prone forests, which lacked tolerant species, exhibited the trade-off. Supported by a theoretical model, our findings raise questions about whether the growth\textendash mortality trade-off is a universally applicable organizing framework for understanding tropical forest community structure.},

  abstract = {Resource allocation within trees is a zero-sum game. Unavoidable trade-offs dictate that allocation to growth-promoting functions curtails other functions, generating a gradient of investment in growth versus survival along which tree species align, known as the interspecific growth\textendash mortality trade-off. This paradigm is widely accepted but not well established. Using demographic data for 1,111 tree species across ten tropical forests, we tested the generality of the growth\textendash mortality trade-off and evaluated its underlying drivers using two species-specific parameters describing resource allocation strategies: tolerance of resource limitation and responsiveness of allocation to resource access. Globally, a canonical growth\textendash mortality trade-off emerged, but the trade-off was strongly observed only in less disturbance-prone forests, which contained diverse resource allocation strategies. Only half of disturbance-prone forests, which lacked tolerant species, exhibited the trade-off. Supported by a theoretical model, our findings raise questions about whether the growth\textendash mortality trade-off is a universally applicable organizing framework for understanding tropical forest community structure.},

  abstract = {The evolutionarily stable size of attractive structures of a flower was analyzed theoretically to examine the factors that select for the differences in the size of attractive structures of a flower depending on the sexuality and self-fertilization rate. In the first analysis, it was assumed that the size\textendash number trade-off for flowers is non-linear (the size of individual flowers increases less rapidly than in a linear trade-off with a decrease in the number of flowers, as would occur during a linear trade-off) and the frequency of pollinator visits per flower depends on the size of attractive structures of individual flowers, but is independent of the number of flowers on the plant. In this case the size of attractive structures is larger in male flowers than in female flowers in dioecious plants, and this size decreases with an increase in the self-fertilization rate for hermaphroditic plants (where both are consistent with the general trends observed). In the second analysis, it was assumed that the size\textendash number trade-off for flowers is linear and the frequency of pollinator visits per flower depends not only on the size of attractive structures of individual flowers, but also on the number of flowers on the plant. However, the results were inconsistent with the general trends in this case; namely, that the size of the attractive structures is smaller in male flowers than in female flowers in dioecious plants, and this size increases with an increase in self-fertilization rate for hermaphroditic plants. I therefore conclude that the non-linearity in size\textendash number trade-offs for flowers is a more useful factor to use to explain the general trends in the size of attractive structures of a flower. This also suggests that the attractive function hypothesis, that is, the differences in fitness gains through allocation to attractive structures between males and females and among plants with different self-fertilization rates, are important factors, but alone cannot explain the general trends.},

Life history theory predicts that the evolution of floral display is constrained by trade-offs between the size and number of flowers and inflorescences. Indeed, a trade-off between flower size and flower number is a key assumption of models of inflorescence architecture and the evolution of floral display. Surprisingly, however, empirical evidence for the trade-off is limited. In particular, there is a lack of phylogenetic evidence for a trade-off between flower size and number. Analyses of phylogenetic independent contrasts (PICs) of 251 angiosperm species spanning 63 families yielded a significant negative correlation between flower size and flower number. At smaller phylogenetic scales, analyses of individual genera did not always find evidence of a trade-off, a result consistent with previous studies that have examined the trade-off for a single species or genus. Ours is the first study to support an angiosperm-wide trade-off between flower size and number and supports the theory that life history constraints have influenced the evolution of floral display.},

However, due to urbanization, and human development activities lot of excess light generated in environment during night time and responsible for anthropogenic generated pollution (ALAN; artificial night light pollution). This pollution has cause for serious problem in plants as it affects their processes and functions which are under the control of light or diurnal cycle. Plant biorhythms mostly diurnal rhythms such as stomatal movements, photosynthetic activity, and many more metabolic processes are under the control of period of light and dark, which are crucially affected by artificial light at night. Similarly, the crucial plant processes such as pollination, flowering, and yield determining processes are controlled by the diurnal cycle and ALAN affects these processes and ultimately hampers the plant fitness and development. To keep in mind the effect of artificial light at night on plant biorhythm and eco-physiological processes, this chapter will focus on the status of global artificial night light pollution and the responsible factors. Further, we will explore the details mechanisms of plant biorhythm and eco-physiological processes under artificial light at night and how this mechanism can be a global threat. Then at the end we will focus on the ANLP reducing strategies such as new light policy, advanced lightening technology such as remote sensing and lightening utilisation optimisation.},

  abstract = {At global and regional scales, tree mortality rates are positively correlated with forest net primary productivity (NPP). Yet causes of the correlation are unknown, in spite of potentially profound implications for our understanding of environmental controls of forest structure and dynamics and, more generally, our understanding of broad-scale environmental controls of population dynamics and ecosystem processes. Here we seek to shed light on the causes of geographic patterns in tree mortality rates, and we consider some implications of the positive correlation between mortality rates and NPP. To reach these ends, we present seven hypotheses potentially explaining the correlation, develop an approach to help distinguish among the hypotheses, and apply the approach in a case study comparing a tropical and temperate forest. Based on our case study and literature synthesis, we conclude that no single mechanism controls geographic patterns of tree mortality rates. At least four different mechanisms may be at play, with the dominant mechanisms depending on whether the underlying productivity gradients are caused by climate or soil fertility. Two of the mechanisms are consequences of environmental selection for certain combinations of life-history traits, reflecting trade-offs between growth and defense (along edaphic productivity gradients) and between reproduction and persistence (as manifested in the adult tree stature continuum along climatic and edaphic gradients). The remaining two mechanisms are consequences of environmental influences on the nature and strength of ecological interactions: competition (along edaphic gradients) and pressure from plant enemies (along climatic gradients). For only one of these four mechanisms, competition, can high mortality rates be considered to be a relatively direct consequence of high NPP. The remaining mechanisms force us to adopt a different view of causality, in which tree growth rates and probability of mortality can vary with at least a degree of independence along productivity gradients. In many cases, rather than being a direct cause of high mortality rates, NPP may remain high in spite of high mortality rates. The independent influence of plant enemies and other factors helps explain why forest biomass can show little correlation, or even negative correlation, with forest NPP.},

  abstract = {At global and regional scales, tree mortality rates are positively correlated with forest net primary productivity (NPP). Yet causes of the correlation are unknown, in spite of potentially profound implications for our understanding of environmental controls of forest structure and dynamics and, more generally, our understanding of broad-scale environmental controls of population dynamics and ecosystem processes. Here we seek to shed light on the causes of geographic patterns in tree mortality rates, and we consider some implications of the positive correlation between mortality rates and NPP. To reach these ends, we present seven hypotheses potentially explaining the correlation, develop an approach to help distinguish among the hypotheses, and apply the approach in a case study comparing a tropical and temperate forest. Based on our case study and literature synthesis, we conclude that no single mechanism controls geographic patterns of tree mortality rates. At least four different mechanisms may be at play, with the dominant mechanisms depending on whether the underlying productivity gradients are caused by climate or soil fertility. Two of the mechanisms are consequences of environmental selection for certain combinations of life-history traits, reflecting trade-offs between growth and defense (along edaphic productivity gradients) and between reproduction and persistence (as manifested in the adult tree stature continuum along climatic and edaphic gradients). The remaining two mechanisms are consequences of environmental influences on the nature and strength of ecological interactions: competition (along edaphic gradients) and pressure from plant enemies (along climatic gradients). For only one of these four mechanisms, competition, can high mortality rates be considered to be a relatively direct consequence of high NPP. The remaining mechanisms force us to adopt a different view of causality, in which tree growth rates and probability of mortality can vary with at least a degree of independence along productivity gradients. In many cases, rather than being a direct cause of high mortality rates, NPP may remain high in spite of high mortality rates. The independent influence of plant enemies and other factors helps explain why forest biomass can show little correlation, or even negative correlation, with forest NPP.},

  abstract = {Replication is widely adopted in modern Internet applications and distributed systems to improve the reliability and performance. Though maintaining the strong consistency among replicas can guarantee the correctness of application behaviors, however, it will affect the application performance at the same time because there is a well-known trade-off between consistency and performance. Many real-world applications favoring performance often choose to enforce weak consistency. Although there has been some work on flexible configuration of consistency, most focuses on design or deployment time. As the system settings constantly change during runtime, the tuning of the consistency-performance trade-off needs to be handled dynamically. Failing to do that will cause either underestimation or overestimation of the consistency and performance that can be achieved. Existing work does not well support the dynamic tuning of the aforementioned trade-off in runtime, which is mainly because of the lack of an appropriate quantitative model of consistency and performance. In this work, based on our previous effort on the quantitative model of consistency and latency, we design a replication protocol, CC-Paxos, to achieve an adaptive trade-off between consistency and performance according to application preferences and runtime information. By design, CC-Paxos is not bound to any specific underlying data stores. We have implemented CC-Paxos and applied it to MySQL databases. And real experiments both within a data center and across data centers show that CC-Paxos not only can dynamically adjust the delivered consistency in return for ensured performance but also outperforms MySQL Cluster in the case of strong consistency guarantee.

  abstract = {The subject of this paper, sun leaves are thicker and show higher photosynthetic rates than the shade leaves, is approached in two ways. The first seeks to answer the question: why are sun leaves thicker than shade leaves? To do this, CO2 diffusion within a leaf is examined first. Because affinity of Rubisco for CO2 is low, the carboxylation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is competitively inhibited by O2, and the oxygenation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate leads to energy-consuming photorespiration, it is essential for C3 plants to maintain the CO2 concentration in the chloroplast as high as possible. Since the internal conductance for CO2 diffusion from the intercellular space to the chloroplast stroma is finite and relatively small, C3 leaves should have sufficient mesophyll surfaces occupied by chloroplasts to secure the area for CO2 dissolution and transport. This explains why sun leaves are thicker. The second approach is mechanistic or `how-oriented'. Mechanisms are discussed as to how sun leaves become thicker than shade leaves, in particular, the long-distance signal transduction from mature leaves to leaf primordia inducing the periclinal division of the palisade tissue cells. To increase the mesophyll surface area, the leaf can either be thicker or have smaller cells. Issues of cell size are discussed to understand plasticity in leaf thickness.},

We discuss briefly the philosophy of Bayesian inference and then present several algorithms for ABC. We then apply these algorithms in a number of examples. For most of these examples, the posterior distributions are known, and so we can compare the estimated posteriors derived from ABC to the true posteriors and verify that the algorithms recover the true posteriors accurately. We also consider a popular simulation-based model of recognition memory (REM) for which the true posteriors are unknown. We conclude with a number of recommendations for applying ABC methods to solve real-world problems.},

The ABC approach is instrumental when a likelihood function for a model cannot be mathematically specified, or has a complicated form. Although difficulty in calculating a model's likelihood is extremely common, current ABC methods suffer from two problems that have largely prevented their mainstream adoption: long computation time and an inability to scale beyond a few parameters. We introduce differential evolution as a computationally efficient genetic algorithm for proposal generation in our ABC sampler. We show how using this method allows our new ABC algorithm, called ABCDE, to obtain accurate posterior estimates in fewer iterations than kernel-based ABC algorithms and to scale to high-dimensional parameter spaces that have proven difficult for current ABC methods.},

Some research had already been done to develop such model, but they mainly focus only on finding the optimal allocation based on man-hour needs without considering the related-cost, such as different hiring cost. Assignment of the workforce is presumably highlighted only in respective skills or task with no consideration of least hiring cost. Most research also considers only one resource in the model, which commonly is the workforce. This study proposes a resource allocation model in an aircraft line maintenance, which involves not only the workforce but also the material and tools. In this paper, we also accommodate the relationship between stations in terms of the possibility of resource transfers amongst them. The model is solved using the IBM\textregistered{} ILOG\textregistered CPLEX software. The result shows that the proposed model can be used to find an optimal resource allocation and the minimum total cost.},

Dimensions that can readily be measured would be especially useful, because they might offer a path towards improved worldwide synthesis across the thousands of field experiments and ecophysiological studies that use just a few species each. Four dimensions are reviewed here. The leaf mass per area-leaf lifespan (LMA-LL) dimension expresses slow turnover of plant parts (at high LMA and long LL), long nutrient residence times, and slow response to favorable growth conditions. The seed mass-seed output (SM-SO) dimension is an important predictor of dispersal to establishment opportunities (seed output) and of establishment success in the face of hazards (seed mass). The LMA-LL and SM-SO dimensions are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible tradeoff, and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf size-twig size (LS-TS) spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size are poorly understood. The height dimension has universally been seen as ecologically important and included in ecological strategy schemes. Nevertheless, height includes several tradeoffs and adaptive elements, which ideally should be treated separately. Each of these four dimensions varies at the scales of climate zones and of site types within landscapes. This variation can be interpreted as adaptation to the physical environment. Each dimension also varies widely among coexisting species. Most likely this within-site variation arises because the ecological opportunities for each species depend strongly on which other species are present, in other words, because the set of species at a site is a stable mixture of strategies.},

Using a large new unpublished database, we examine the variability of specific leaf area and other leaf traits, the relationships between them, and their ability to predict position on the resource use axis. Specific leaf area is found to suffer from a number of drawbacks; it is both very variable between replicates and much influenced by leaf thickness. Leaf dry-matter content (sometimes referred to as tissue density) is much less variable, largely independent of leaf thickness and a better predictor of location on an axis of resource capture, usage and availability.

  abstract = {1 Leaf life span (LL) and leaf mass per area (LMA) are fundamental traits in the carbon economy of plants, representing the investment required per unit leaf area (LMA) and the duration of the resulting benefit (LL). Species on dry and infertile soils converge towards higher LMA. It has been generally assumed that this allows species from low-resource habitats to achieve longer average leaf life spans, as LMA and LL are often correlated. 2 Leaf life span and LMA were measured for 75 perennial species from eastern Australia. Species were sampled from nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites within high and low rainfall regions. LL and LMA were positively correlated across species within each site. In addition, evolutionary divergences in LL and LMA were correlated within each site, indicating that cross-species relationships were not simply driven by differences between higher taxonomic groups. 3 Within a rainfall zone, LL\textendash LMA combinations shifted as expected along common axes of variation such that species on poorer soils had higher LMA and longer LL, but significantly so only at high rainfall. 4 Low rainfall species were expected to have shorter LL at a given LMA or, equally, require higher LMA to achieve a given LL, i.e. shift to a parallel axis of variation, and this was observed on both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils. On average, 30\% higher LMA was seemingly required at dry sites to achieve a given LL. Thus, convergence towards higher LMA has different consequences for leaf life span in dry and nutrient-poor habitats. 5 The broad shifts in LL\textendash LMA combinations between site types were also seen when comparing closely related species-pairs (phylogenetically independent contrasts) occurring on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils (within each rainfall zone), and at high- and low-rainfall sites (at each soil nutrient level).},

  abstract = {1 Most plants withdraw nutrients from leaves as they age, and redeploy them elsewhere in the plant. The proportion of nutrients resorbed and the residual nutrient concentration in senesced leaves are different but complementary indices of nutrient conservation via this process. A major spectrum of strategic variation runs from plant species with typically long leaf lifespan (LL), high leaf mass per area (LMA), low leaf nutrient concentrations, and low photosynthetic capacity, to species with the opposite characteristics. It is unknown to what extent either facet of resorption covaries with the LL\textendash LMA spectrum. 2 Green-leaf and senesced-leaf N and P concentrations were quantified for 73 evergreen species from four sites in eastern Australia (nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites in each of two rainfall zones). Leaf nutrient concentrations in green and senesced leaves were negatively correlated with LL across all species and at most sites, especially if N2-fixing species were excluded from analyses involving leaf N. 3 Proportional resorption did not differ with soil nutrients, as has been found elsewhere, nor was it correlated with LL. Green-leaf and senesced-leaf nutrient concentrations were lower for species on poorer soils. A simple model was described in which the proportion of resorbed vs soil-derived nutrients deployed in new leaves is set by the relative cost of nutrients from the two sources. The model provides a prospective explanation for the observed differences between species from nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor habitats. 4 The results from this study provide support for the argument that selection to minimize nutrient losses has affected the residual nutrient concentration in senesced leaves, rather than proportional resorption per se. Further, variation among species in residual nutrient concentration was correlated with one of the key spectra of strategic variation between plant species, the leaf lifespan\textendash LMA axis of variation.},

  abstract = {A trade-off between growth and mortality rates characterizes tree species in closed canopy forests. This trade-off is maintained by inherent differences among species and spatial variation in light availability caused by canopy-opening disturbances. We evaluated conditions under which the trade-off is expressed and relationships with four key functional traits for 103 tree species from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The trade-off is strongest for saplings for growth rates of the fastest growing individuals and mortality rates of the slowest growing individuals (r2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.69), intermediate for saplings for average growth rates and overall mortality rates (r2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.46), and much weaker for large trees (r2 0.10). This parallels likely levels of spatial variation in light availability, which is greatest for fast- vs. slow-growing saplings and least for large trees with foliage in the forest canopy. Inherent attributes of species contributing to the trade-off include abilities to disperse, acquire resources, grow rapidly, and tolerate shade and other stresses. There is growing interest in the possibility that functional traits might provide insight into such ecological differences and a growing consensus that seed mass (SM), leaf mass per area (LMA), wood density (WD), and maximum height (Hmax) are key traits among forest trees. Seed mass, LMA, WD, and Hmax are predicted to be small for light-demanding species with rapid growth and mortality and large for shade-tolerant species with slow growth and mortality. Six of these trait\textendash demographic rate predictions were realized for saplings; however, with the exception of WD, the relationships were weak (r2 , 0.1 for three and r2 , 0.2 for five of the six remaining relationships). The four traits together explained 43\textendash 44\% of interspecific variation in species positions on the growth\textendash mortality trade-off; however, WD alone accounted for .80\% of the explained variation and, after WD was included, LMA and Hmax made insignificant contributions. Virtually the full range of values of SM, LMA, and Hmax occurred at all positions on the growth\textendash mortality trade-off. Although WD provides a promising start, a successful traitbased ecology of tropical forest trees will require consideration of additional traits.},

The added nutrients include nitrogen (N) in 36 experiments, phosphorus (P) in 33 experiments, calcium and potassium in one experiment each, and various mixtures of essential nutrients in the remaining experiments. I evaluate the hypotheses that nutrients limit tropical forest plants, nutrient limitation is stronger in successional than in old-growth forests, P but not N is limiting in lowland forests, and N is limiting in montane forests. Responses to the most complete nutrient mix used in each experiment were strong for plant functions that contribute to aboveground production (Hedges' g averages 0.87) and nonsignificant for fine root biomass. Responses to N addition and to P addition were strong for tissue concentrations of the added element (Hedges' g averages 0.75 and 1.4, respectively), moderate for fine litter production (0.64 and 0.65, respectively), moderate to weak for plant growth (0.46 and 0.37, respectively) and nonsignificant for fine root biomass. Growth responses were stronger in successional than in old-growth forests. All responses were unrelated to elevation. The 48 experiments included 30 factorial nitrogen-phosphorus experiments that enable additional direct tests of the widely cited hypotheses that P limitation is stronger than N limitation in lowland forests and vice versa in montane forests. Both hypotheses were rejected. The N \texttimes{} P interaction effect was nonsignificant across the factorial experiments. In conclusion, nutrients clearly limit tropical forest plants. Limitation by N is widespread in both lowland and montane forests, and the same is true for P. Single experiments identify limitation by calcium and potassium, and correlative studies suggest limitation by calcium, potassium, and magnesium. The available evidence is consistent with the possibility that most macronutrients limit tropical forest plants; however, experiments focus almost exclusively on N and P. The way forward will include taking fuller advantage of existing nutrient addition experiments, siting new experiments strategically, and developing cost-effective methods to assay responses to all of the essential nutrients soils supply to plants.},

  abstract = {Gaining a better comprehension of the growth of microorganisms is a major scientific challenge, which has often been approached from a resource allocation perspective. Simple mathematical self-replicator models based on resource allocation principles have been surprisingly effective in accounting for experimental observations of the growth of microorganisms. Previous work, using a three-variable resource allocation model, predicted an optimal resource allocation scheme for the adaptation of microbial cells to a sudden nutrient change in the environment. We here propose an extended version of this model considering also proteins responsible for basic housekeeping functions, and we study their impact on predicted optimal strategies for resource allocation following changes in the environment. A full dynamical analysis of the system shows there is a single globally attractive equilibrium, which can be related to steady-state growth conditions of bacteria observed in experiments. We then explore the optimal allocation strategies using optimization and optimal control theory. We show that the solutions to this dynamical problem have a complicated structure that includes a second-order singular arc given in feedback form and characterized by (i) Fuller's phenomenon and (ii) the turnpike effect, producing a very particular asymptotic behavior towards the solution of the static optimization problem. Our work thus provides a generalized perspective on the analysis of microbial growth by means of simple self-replicator models.},

  abstract = {Understanding evolutionary forces that maintain sexual reproduction has been a central question in evolutionary biology, because the well-known ``two-fold'' cost of sex demands an explanation, especially since asexual reproduction (vegetative reproduction and parthenogenesis) often arises by mutation and hybridization. Geographic parthenogenesis, where asexual reproduction by close relatives of sexual lineages tends to be found in ``marginal'' habitats, has been considered a key pattern for studying the maintenance of sex. Recent studies of sexually reproducing populations have revealed that mating attempts by males can be harmful to females due to sexual conflict. Where that occurs and where there is a mixture of both sexual and asexual females, if male mating harassment is more harmful to asexual females than to sexual females, this may prevent the invasion of rare asexuals. Here, we use a simple ecological model with density-dependent male mating harassment to show how asexual reproduction can become prevalent in habitats when environmental conditions are poor (i.e., low carrying capacities). The maintenance of sex is possible in a bistable system where abundant males are so harmful that they prevent the invasion of rare asexuals. However, male density is not large enough to suppress asexuals and sex is lost when carrying capacities are low or when sex ratio is highly male-biased. While previous theoretical studies employed a frequency-dependent model to study male mating harassment, we demonstrate that density-dependence may be important to explain the dynamics in low population densities where there is geographical parthenogenesis.},

We show that this interaction between rapid evolution and temporal fluctuations not only increases the range of coexistence conditions under a gleaner-opportunist trade-off (i.e. low minimum resource requirement [R*] vs. high maximum growth rate) but also yields stable coexistence in the absence of a classical gleaner-opportunist trade-off. Given the propensity for both oscillatory dynamics and different rates of adaptation between species (including rapid evolution and phenotypic plasticity) in the real world, we argue that this expansion of fluctuation-dependent coexistence theory provides an important overlooked solution to the so-called `paradox of the plankton'.},
