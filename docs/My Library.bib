  abstract = {In forest gaps, the geometry of canopy openings above a plant determines the spatial distribution of diffuse and direct radiation, which may be received from different sectors of the sky. We examined crown orientation and light interception by seedlings of four species of pioneer trees, Cecropia obtusifolia, Heliocarpus appendiculatus, Piper auritum, and Trema micrantha, transplanted into natural forest gaps at the Los Tuxtlas Tropical Biology Station, Veracruz, Mexico. The four species differed in the number and mean size of leaves, but total leaf area was not significantly different among equal age plants. The mean azimuth and zenith angle of diffuse and direct radiation were determined from hemispherical photographs taken above each plant. Mean diffuse radiation vectors were distributed around the zenith, with a significant clustering in an easterly direction, while mean direct radiation vectors were distributed along the solar track in the southern portion of the sky. The mean orientation of the crown of each seedling was determined from detailed, three\textemdash dimensional reconstruction of leaf display using a canopy architecture model. A directional correlation test indicated that seedling crowns were orientation of individual leaves. The mechanisms of this differential response to diffuse vs. direct radiation are not known. For diffuse radiation, the total light capture capacity integrated over all sky directions increased with seedling leaf area, while efficiency of capture per unit area decreased. Based on simulations, the light interception efficiency of each plant in its own microsite was 5\textemdash 25\% greater than would be achieved in the sites of conspecifics of in symmetric canopy openings centered on the zenith. These analyses provide a quantitative estimate of the value of nonrandom leaf and crown orientation for whole\textemdash plant light interception in natural environments.},

The primary damage occurs within the reaction center of Photosystem II (PS II). While irreversible photoinduced damage to PS II occurs at all light intensities, the efficiency of photosynthetic electron transfer decreases markedly only when the rate of damage exceeds the rate of its repair, which requires de novo PS II protein synthesis. Photoinhibition has been studied for over a century using a large variety of biochemical, biophysical and genetic methodologies. The discovery of the light induced turnover of a protein, encoded by the plastid psbA gene (the D1 protein), later identified as one of the photochemical reaction center II proteins, has led to the elucidation of the underlying mechanism of photoinhibition and to a deeper understanding of the PS II `life cycle.'},

  abstract = {Plants have evolved diverse life history strategies to succeed in Earth's varied environments. Some species grow quickly, produce copious seeds, and die within a few weeks. Other species grow slowly and rarely produce seeds but live thousands of years. We show that simple morphological measurements can predict where a species falls within the global range of life history strategies: species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have population growth rates influenced primarily by survival, whereas individual growth and fecundity have a stronger influence on the dynamics of species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. This finding increases the ability of scientists to represent complex population processes with a few easily measured character traits., Ecologists seek general explanations for the dramatic variation in species abundances in space and time. An increasingly popular solution is to predict species distributions, dynamics, and responses to environmental change based on easily measured anatomical and morphological traits. Trait-based approaches assume that simple functional traits influence fitness and life history evolution, but rigorous tests of this assumption are lacking, because they require quantitative information about the full lifecycles of many species representing different life histories. Here, we link a global traits database with empirical matrix population models for 222 species and report strong relationships between functional traits and plant life histories. Species with large seeds, long-lived leaves, or dense wood have slow life histories, with mean fitness (i.e., population growth rates) more strongly influenced by survival than by growth or fecundity, compared with fast life history species with small seeds, short-lived leaves, or soft wood. In contrast to measures of demographic contributions to fitness based on whole lifecycles, analyses focused on raw demographic rates may underestimate the strength of association between traits and mean fitness. Our results help establish the physiological basis for plant life history evolution and show the potential for trait-based approaches in population dynamics.},

The model is a Lotka-Volterra competition system with diffusion and with spatial variation in some coefficients. The coefficients in the model are taken to reflect a situation where the larger competitor typically disperses farther in unit time than the smaller and reproduces less rapidly, but has an advantage in contests or other forms of interference competition. The environment is assumed to be closed, i.e., it is assumed that individuals do not leave through the boundary. The environment is generally assumed to consist of a patch of favorable habitat surrounded by less favorable regions. The effects of spatial scale are studied by examining how the predictions of the model change as the size of the favorable patch is varied. The predictions turn out to be in qualitative agreement with the results of some empirical studies.},

  abstract = {The so-called size-complexity rule claims the existence of a positive correlation between organism size and number of cell types. In this spirit, here we address the relationship between organism size and number of potential tasks that can be performed. The modeling relies on the assumption that the states of the cells within the aggregates are such that the maximum fitness is realized, but also relies on the existence of tradeoffs among the distinct functions. For group sizes larger than the number of potential tasks, fitness maximization is attained when all cells in group specialize in a given task. Under this scenario, the number of potential tasks equals the number of cell types. We have found that the morphology and the topology of aggregates, as well as the developmental mode, strongly influence the dynamics of body formation. Particularly, it has been observed that more compact structures, such as sphere-like structures, are more likely to follow the claim of the size-complexity rule, whereas more fragile structures such as linear chains, which are more vulnerable to drastic changes due to division mechanisms, can, in a broad scenario, violate the size-complexity rule.},

  abstract = {Although trade-offs are expected to play an essential role in shaping the diversity in a community, their effects remain relatively nebulous and notoriously difficult to assess. This is especially true when multiple trade-offs of different classes interact, a situation here designated by multidimensional trade-offs. When dealing with single trade-offs, some information can be predicted solely based on their curvature. Does this generalize to when dealing with multidimensional trade-offs? What happens if the trade-offs have opposing curvatures? To address these issues, we develop a resource-based model that encompasses multiple trade-offs mediated by the acquisition and processing of resources. Two distinct classes of trade-offs are assumed: (1) a trade-off among resource uptake rates, (2) a tradeoff between the resource uptake rate and yield of the process of conversion of resource into energy. The model considers a spatially structured population of microbial organisms that grow on an arbitrary number of resources. These resources flow into the system at a constant rate and diffuse through the environment. The individuals can adopt a variety of strategies through mutation constrained by trade-offs, which renders the model adaptive. We assess population sizes and levels of ecological specialization. The analysis of the results reveals that when multidimensional trade-offs are considered the classical intuition stemming from single trade-offs does not hold. The outcome can depend significantly not only on the curvature of the trade-offs but also on resource availability.},

(1) The theory of games with asymmetrical information shows that the right incentives allow hosts to screen-out parasites and screen-in mutualists, explaining successful partner choice in the absence of signalling. Applications range from ant-plants to microbiomes. (2) Contract theory distinguishes two longstanding but weakly differentiated explanations of host response to defectors: host sanctions and partner fidelity feedback. Host traits that selectively punish misbehaving symbionts are parsimoniously interpreted as pre-adaptations. Yucca-moth and legume-rhizobia mutualisms are argued to be examples of partner fidelity feedback. (3) The theory of public goods shows that cooperation in multi-player interactions can evolve in the absence of assortment, in one-shot social dilemmas among non-kin. Applications include alarm calls in vertebrates and exoenzymes in microbes.},

Although observational causal inference methodologies exist, predictive techniques such as model selection based on information criterion (e.g. AIC) remains a common approach used to understand ecological relationships. However, predictive approaches are not appropriate for drawing causal conclusions. Here, we highlight the distinction between predictive and causal inference and show how predictive techniques can lead to biased causal estimates. Instead, we encourage ecologists to valid causal inference methods such as the backdoor criterion, a graphical rule that can be used to determine causal relationships across observational studies.},

  abstract = {Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a trait of central importance to plant physiology and ecosystem function, but LMA patterns in the upper canopies of humid tropical forests have proved elusive due to tall species and high diversity. We collected top-of-canopy leaf samples from 2873 individuals in 57 sites spread across the Neotropics, Australasia, and Caribbean and Pacific Islands to quantify environmental and taxonomic drivers of LMA variation, and to advance remote-sensing measures of LMA. We uncovered strong taxonomic organization of LMA, with species accounting for 70\% of the global variance and up to 62\% of the variation within a forest stand. Climate, growth habit, and site conditions are secondary contributors (1\textendash 23\%) to the observed LMA patterns. Intraspecific variation in LMA averages 16\%, which is a fraction of the variation observed between species. We then used spectroscopic remote sensing (400\textendash 2500 nm) to estimate LMA with an absolute uncertainty of 14\textendash 15 g/m2 (r2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.85), or ;10\% of the global mean. With radiative transfer modeling, we demonstrated the scalability of spectroscopic remote sensing of LMA to the canopy level. Our study indicates that remotely sensed patterns of LMA will be driven by taxonomic variation against a backdrop of environmental controls expressed at site and regional levels.},

There has been some evaluation of the factors influencing the size of light trap catches1-5 and of the mechanics of the terminal phase of the moth's approach to a light6, but virtually nothing is understood about the light-trap response itself. Such an understanding is perhaps unnecessary when light traps are used solely to collect specimens, but becomes crucial as soon as they are used for quantitative sampling or survey work7. Of particular importance to the interpretation of such work is a knowledge of the distance from which moths orientate with respect to a light source; it seems intuitively that this distance should be fairly large. We present here the results of three experiments designed to determine the distance of response of free-flying moths to an artificial light source. Our results support Sotthibandhu's claim4 that the effective range of a 125 W mercury vapour (MV) lamp is about 3 m. They also lead to speculation concerning the behavioural meaning of the light trap response in moths.},

  abstract = {Many insects feed on a low-nitrogen diet, and the origin of their nitrogen supply is poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that some insects rely on nitrogen-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) to supplement their diets. Nitrogen fixation by diazotrophs has been extensively studied and convincingly demonstrated in termites, while evidence for the occurrence and role of nitrogen fixation in the diet of other insects is less conclusive. Here, we summarize the methods to detect nitrogen fixation in insects and review the available evidence for its occurrence (focusing on insects other than termites). We distinguish between three aspects of nitrogen fixation investigations: (i) detecting the presence of potential diazotrophs; (ii) detecting the activity of the nitrogen-fixing enzyme; and (iii) detecting the assimilation of fixed nitrogen into the insect tissues. We show that although evidence from investigations of the first aspect reveals ample opportunities for interactions with potential diazotrophs in a variety of insects, demonstrations of actual biological nitrogen fixation and the assimilation of fixed nitrogen are restricted to very few insect groups, including wood-feeding beetles, fruit flies, leafcutter ants, and a wood wasp. We then discuss potential implications for the insect's fitness and for the ecosystem as a whole. We suggest that combining these multiple approaches is crucial for the study of nitrogen fixation in insects, and argue that further demonstrations are desperately needed in order to determine the relative importance of diazotrophs for insect diet and fitness, as well as to evaluate their overall impact on the ecosystem.},

Our goal is for both theoretical and empirical ecologists to be able to use the theory to interpret their findings, and to get a precise sense of the limits of its applicability. To this end, we introduce an explicit handling of limiting factors, and a new way of defining the scaling factors that partition invasion growth rates into the different mechanisms contributing to coexistence. We explain terminology such as relative nonlinearity, storage effect, and growth-density covariance, both in a formal setting and through their biological interpretation. We review the theory's applications and contributions to our current understanding of species coexistence. While the theory is very general, it is not well suited to all problems, so we carefully point out its limitations. Finally, we critique the paradigm of decomposing invasion growth rates into stabilizing and equalizing components: we argue that these concepts are useful when used judiciously, but have often been employed in an overly simplified way to justify false claims.},

  abstract = {Many plants have evolved adaptations in order to survive in low nitrogen environments. One of the best-known adaptations is that of plant symbiosis with  nitrogen-fixing bacteria; this is the major route by which nitrogen is incorporated into plant biomass. A portion of this plant-associated nitrogen is then lost to insects through herbivory, and insects represent a nitrogen reservoir that is generally overlooked in nitrogen cycles. In this review we show three specialized plant adaptations that allow for the recovery of insect nitrogen; that is, plants gaining nitrogen from insects. First, we show specialized adaptations by carnivorous plants in low nitrogen habitats. Insect carnivorous plants such as pitcher plants and sundews (Nepenthaceae/Sarraceniaceae and Drosera respectively) are able to obtain substantial amounts of nitrogen from the insects that they capture. Secondly, numerous plants form associations with mycorrhizal fungi that can provide soluble nitrogen from the soil, some of which may be insect-derived nitrogen, obtained from decaying insects or insect frass. Finally, a specialized group of endophytic, insect-pathogenic fungi (EIPF) provide host plants with insect-derived nitrogen. These soil-inhabiting fungi form a remarkable symbiosis with certain plant species. They can infect a wide range of insect hosts and also form endophytic associations in which they transfer insect-derived nitrogen to the plant. Root colonizing fungi are found in disparate fungal phylogenetic lineages, indicating possible convergent evolutionary strategies between taxa, evolution potentially driven by access to carbon-containing root exudates.},

We define a stochastic model where the predators and prey dynamically interact. The novelty of the model holds on the fact that predators and prey dynamics are simultaneously affected by correlated environ\- mental noises. Interacting predators and prey are harvested using a proportional threshold harvesting strategy that accounts for stochastic population dynamics. Optimal yield of prey can be obtained with identical harvesting strategies when the predators and prey responded to the environment similarly (i.e., synchrony between species) and differently (i.e., asynchrony between species). Remarkably, our study demonstrates that two different har\- vesting strategies, the proportional harvesting strategy for the prey and the proportional threshold harvesting strategy for the predators, are needed to optimize the annual yield of predators and prey when both species are harvested simultaneously. Our study finds optimal strategies for harvesting interacting species affected by environmental variations (i.e., correlated noises) with parameters representing the joint dynamics of predators and prey at a stable state.},

  abstract = {Human settlements and transport networks are growing rapidly worldwide. Since the early 20th century their expansion has been accompanied by increasing illumination of the environment at night, a trend that is likely to continue over the decades to come. Consequently, a growing proportion of the world's ecosystems are exposed to artificial light at night, profoundly altering natural cycles of light and darkness. While in recent years there have been advances in our understanding of the effects of artificial light at night on the behaviour and physiology of animals in the wild, much less is known about the impacts on wild plants and natural or semi-natural vegetation composition. This is surprising, as effects of low-intensity light at night on flowering, phenology and growth form are well known in laboratory and greenhouse studies. In a long-term experimental field study we exposed a semi-natural grassland to artificial light at intensities and wavelengths typical of those experienced by roadside vegetation under street lighting. We found that lighting affected the trajectory of vegetation change, leading to significant differences in biomass and plant cover in the dominant species. Changes in flowering phenology were variable between years, with grass species flowering between 4 days earlier and 12 days later under artificial light. Policy implications. Our results demonstrate that artificial light, at levels equivalent to those in street-lit environments, can affect species composition in semi-natural vegetation.

  abstract = {Several different measures of `fitness' are commonly used in evolutionary studies. Each measure makes different assumptions, so is appropriate only in some circumstances. Many recent studies have recommended using invasibility arguments to identify the evolutionarily unbeatable strategy (EUS), rather than choosing a measure of fitness to maximize, thereby avoiding the potential pitfalls in choosing. Here we use the `invasion exponent' to determine the EUS of reproductive allocation in environments that vary in density dependence and environmental stochasticity. We then compare the EUS effort with that predicted by a range of other measures of fitness: r (the deterministic per capita rate of increase), a (the stochastic per capita rate of increase), R0 (lifetime reproductive success) and population size (arithmetic and geometric means). When the population is at an equilibrium in a constant environment, different measures of fitness predict the same optima. However, when population size is not constant (either due to environmental variation or non-equilibrium dynamics), no single fitness measure universally predicts the EUS. In most circumstances, measures of population size perform best followed by measures of reproductive performance. Measures of population growth perform least well.},

In part, their success might stem from a departure from the discovery\textendash dominance trade-off that can promote co-existence in native ant communities, that is, invasive ants are thought to be at the same time behaviorally dominant and faster discoverers of resources, compared to native species. However, it has not yet been tested whether similar asymmetries in behavioral dominance, exploration, and recruitment abilities also exist among invasive species. Here, we establish a dominance hierarchy among four of the most problematic invasive ants (Linepithema humile, Lasius neglectus, Wasmannia auropunctata, Pheidole megacephala) that may be able to arrive and establish in the same areas in the future. To assess behavioral dominance, we used confrontation experiments, testing the aggressiveness in individual and group interactions between all species pairs. In addition, to compare discovery efficiency, we tested the species' capacity to locate a food resource in a maze, and the capacity to recruit nestmates to exploit a food resource. The four species differed greatly in their capacity to discover resources and to recruit nestmates and to dominate the other species. Our results are consistent with a discovery\textendash dominance trade-off. The species that showed the highest level of interspecific aggressiveness and dominance during dyadic interactions.},

The new method fits a nonlinear conditional heteroscedastic regression of the parameter on the summary statistics, and then adaptively improves estimation using importance sampling.

These trade-offs typically fall along a productive growth to conservative, bet-hedging continuum. How nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) stored in living tree cells (known as carbon stores) fit in this trade-off framework is not well understood. We examined relationships between growth and storage using both within species genetic variation from a common garden, and across species phenotypic variation from a global database. We demonstrate that storage is actively accumulated, as part of a conservative, bet-hedging life history strategy. Storage accumulates at the expense of growth both within and across species. Within the species Populus trichocarpa, genetic trade-offs show that for each additional unit of wood area growth (in cm2 yr-1) that genotypes invest in, they lose 1.2 to 1.7 units (mg g-1 NSC) of storage. Across species, for each additional unit of area growth (in cm2 yr-1), trees, on average, reduce their storage by 9.5\% in stems and 10.4\% in roots. Our findings impact our understanding of basic plant biology, fit storage into a widely used growth-survival trade-off spectrum describing life history strategy, and challenges the assumptions of passive storage made in ecosystem models today.},

There has been extensive theoretical study of the role of such trade-offs in ecological communities but it has proven difficult to study such trade-offs experimentally. Microorganisms are ideal model systems with which to experimentally study the causes and consequences of ecological trade-offs. In model communities of E. coli B and T-type bacteriophage, a trade-off in E. coli between resistance to bacteriophage and competitive ability is often observed. This trade-off can allow the coexistence of different ecological types of E. coli. The magnitude of this trade-off affects, in predictable ways, the structure, dynamics and response to environmental change of these communities. Genetic factors, environmental factors, and gene-by-environment interactions determine the magnitude of this trade-off. Environmental control of the magnitude of trade-offs represents one avenue by which environmental change can alter community properties such as invasability, stability and coexistence.},

Coexistence modelling often disregards variation arising from stochasticity in biological processes, heterogeneity among individuals and plasticity in trait values. However, these unaccounted-for sources of uncertainty are likely to be ecologically important and have the potential to impact estimates of coexistence. We applied a Bayesian modelling framework to data from an annual plant community in Western Australia to propagate uncertainty in coexistence outcomes using the invasion criterion and ratio of niche to fitness differences. We found accounting for this uncertainty altered predictions of coexistence versus competitive exclusion for 3 out of 14 species pairs and yielded a probability of priority effects for an additional species pair. The propagation of uncertainty arising from sources of biological complexity improves our ability to predict coexistence more accurately in natural systems.},

Using a matched-pairs design, we found that street lighting strongly reduced moth caterpillar abundance compared with unlit sites (47\% reduction in hedgerows and 33\% reduction in grass margins) and affected caterpillar development. A separate experiment in habitats with no history of lighting revealed that ALAN disrupted the feeding behavior of nocturnal caterpillars. Negative impacts were more pronounced under white light-emitting diode (LED) street lights compared to conventional yellow sodium lamps. This indicates that ALAN and the ongoing shift toward white LEDs (i.e., narrow- to broad-spectrum lighting) will have substantial consequences for insect populations and ecosystem processes.},

Moths are species-rich, sensitive to ALAN, and have undergone declines in Europe, making them the ideal group for investigating the impacts of light pollution on nocturnal insects more broadly. Here, we take a life cycle approach to review the impacts of ALAN on moths, drawing on a range of disciplines including ecology, physiology, and applied entomology. We find evidence of diverse impacts across most life stages and key behaviours. Many studies have examined flight-to-light behaviour in adults and our meta-analysis found that mercury vapour, metal halide, and compact fluorescent bulbs induce this more than LED and sodium lamps. However, we found that ALAN can also disrupt reproduction, larval development, and pupal diapause, with likely negative impacts on individual fitness, and that moths can be indirectly affected via hostplants and predators. These findings indicate that ALAN could also affect day-flying insects through impacts on earlier life stages. Overall, we found strong evidence for effects of artificial light on moth behaviour and physiology, but little rigorous, direct evidence that this scales up to impacts on populations. Crucially, there is a need to determine the potential contribution of ALAN to insect declines, relative to other drivers of change. In the meantime, we recommend precautionary strategies to mitigate possible negative effects of ALAN on insect populations.},

To this end we assemble a panel data set of sea turtle nesting activity and satellite-derived measures of nighttime light. Controlling for the surveyor effort, the local economic infrastructure, and spatial spillovers, we find that nighttime light significantly reduces the number of sea turtle nests. According to data on replacement costs for sea turtles raised in captivity, our result suggests that the increase in lighting over the last two decades has resulted in the loss of close to 1800 sea turtles in the Caribbean, worth up to \$288 million. Incorporating our empirical estimates into a stage-structured population model, we discover that the dynamic effect of nighttime light on future generations of sea turtles is likely to be much larger, with a cost of approximately \$2.8 billion for Guadeloupe alone. More generally, our study provides a new approach to valuing the cost of environmental pollution associated with species extinction.},

First, that an individual partitions net assimilate between two tissue types: those which can and those which cannot be remobilized once laid down. Second, that the individual modulates its behaviour and physiology in response to the instantaneous ratio of mobilizable to non-mobilizable tissues. 3. The model is parameterized for salmonids from published studies of their energetics. Data from aquaculture studies of fish growth under conditions of fluctuating food are used to test the model. Using a common parameter set, the model successfully reproduces the growth patterns observed in 16 different feeding regimes.}

  abstract = {Estimation of individual fitness \textendash{} i.e. description of the extent to which an individual's genes are represented in future generations \textendash{} is a feature central to most evolutionary studies. Lifetime reproductive success (LRS) is a commonly used estimate of individual fitness, but because it is rate-insensitive (i.e. timing of reproductive events is not incorporated), it may give a biased estimate of fitness when reproductive timing is an important component of fitness. A review of all empirical studies which have used a recently derived, rate-sensitive estimate of individual fitness, {$\lambda$}ind revealed that {$\lambda$}ind ranks the fitness of phenotypes differently from LRS, and that this difference may lead to different conclusions about strength of selection acting on phenotypic traits. However, although {$\lambda$}ind may be a better estimate of individual fitness than LRS in certain situations (e.g. in growing populations), its application is not always unproblematic. For instance, in contrast to rate-insensitive estimates of individual fitness, the {$\lambda$}ind is sensitive to the age at which offspring are censused and there is little consensus among published studies on when offspring should be counted. Further, rate-sensitivity does not necessarily improve a fitness estimate in spatio-temporal variable environments. We suggest that the ultimate test on the applicability of {$\lambda$}ind vs. LRS as practical measures of individual fitness in quantifying selection should come from studies which correlate these estimates with actual number of descendants left more than one generation further in future.},

After accounting for the environment, the five most important key species jointly explained more deviance of productivity than any measure of functional composition alone. Key species were generally tall with high specific leaf areas. By dividing the observations according to distinct habitats, the explanatory power of key species and functional composition increased and key-species plant types and functional composition-productivity relationships varied systematically, presumably because of changing interactions and trade-offs between traits. Our results advocate for a careful consideration of species' individual effects on ecosystem functioning in complement to community-level measures.},

In this study, we use a three-trait trade-off model to explore the evolution of dispersal, reproduction and competitive ability during range expansion. We show that range expansion greatly affects the evolution of life-history traits due to differing selection pressures at the front of the range compared with those found in stationary and core populations. During range expansion, dispersal and reproduction are selected for on the expanding population front, whereas traits associated with fitness at equilibrium density (competitive ability) show dramatic declines. Additionally, we demonstrate that the presence of a competing species can considerably reduce the extent to which dispersal is selected upwards at an expanding front. These findings have important implications for understanding both the rate of spread of invasive species and the range-shifting dynamics of native species in response to climate change.},

  abstract = {Premise Plant responses to herbivores and their elicitors include changes in traits associated with phenology, defense, and reproduction. Induced responses by chewing herbivores are known to be hormonally mediated by the jasmonate pathway and can cascade and affect late-season seed predators and pollinators. Moreover, herbivore-induced plant responses can be transmitted to the next generation. Whether herbivore-induced transgenerational effects also apply to phenological traits is less well understood. Methods Here, we explored responses of wild lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) to herbivory and jasmonate treatment and possible transgenerational effects of herbivore-induced early flowering. In a controlled field experiment, we exposed lima bean plants to herbivory by leaf beetles or methyl jasmonate sprays (MJ). We then compared plant development, phenology, reproductive fitness and seed traits among these treatments and undamaged, untreated control plants. Results We found that MJ and leaf herbivory induced similar responses, with treated plants growing less, flowering earlier, and producing fewer seeds than undamaged plants. However, seed size, phenolics and cyanogenic glycosides concentrations did not differ among treatments. Seed germination rates and flowering time of the offspring were similar among maternal treatments. Conclusions Overall, the results confirm that responses of lima bean to herbivory by leaf beetles are mediated by jasmonate; however, effects on phenological traits are not transmitted to the next generation. We discuss why transgenerational effects of herbivory might be restricted to traits that directly target herbivores.},

However, our understanding of how ecophysiological function allowed establishment in the canopy and the potential transitionary role of the hemi-epiphytic life form remain unclear. Here, we surveyed 39 fern species in Costa Rican tropical forests to explore epiphytic trait divergence in a phylogenetic context. We examined leaf responses to water deficits in terrestrial, hemi-epiphytic and epiphytic ferns and related these findings to functional traits that regulate leaf water status. Epiphytic ferns had reduced xylem area (-63\%), shorter stipe lengths (-56\%), thicker laminae (+41\%) and reduced stomatal density (-46\%) compared to terrestrial ferns. Epiphytic ferns exhibited similar turgor loss points, higher osmotic potential at saturation and lower tissue capacitance after turgor loss than terrestrial ferns. Overall, hemi-epiphytic ferns exhibited traits that share characteristics of both terrestrial and epiphytic species. Our findings clearly demonstrate the prevalence of water conservatism in both epiphytic and hemi-epiphytic ferns, via selection for anatomical and structural traits that avoid leaf water stress. Even with likely evolutionarily constrained physiological function, adaptations for drought avoidance have allowed epiphytic ferns to successfully endure the stresses of the canopy habitat.},

The germination response to light is essential to optimize germination and seedling establishment in space and time. In addition, the germination response to light is a trait often related to the response of the seeds to their position in the soil (uncovered/buried). Here, we studied the germination response to light of four key tree species of the Yungas forest (Anadenanthera colubrina, Enterolobium contortisiliquum, Jacaranda mimosifolia and Handroanthus impetiginosus) sampled along an elevational and environmental gradient with contrasting vegetation cover and disturbance. Relative light germination (RLG) and mean germination time (MGT) were determined. Final germination was tested under cycles of light (8 h) and darkness (16 h) versus complete darkness (24 h) and elevation, and MGT was tested as a function of elevation of the provenance. The RLG increased from smaller to larger-seeded species. The MGT of three of the studied species was affected by the elevation of the provenance. Complete darkness negatively affected final germination, while two species exhibited a significant interaction between the provenance and light. The variable germination responses to light along the elevational gradient highlights the influence of the environment on germination as a key factor that should be considered for forest management, conservation and restoration projects.},

As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

Recent reviews and meta-analyses, aiming to understand how such phenotypic transition could facilitate neopolyploid establishment, demonstrated multifarious immediate effects of WGD on fitness and reproductive traits. Yet, little is known about how short-term modifications evolve through time. Such a comparison among new and established polyploid lineages is crucial to understand which effects of WGD promote or impede polyploid survival. Methods We performed a meta-analysis to determine how WGD affects morphological, cellular, and fitness traits in autotetraploid individuals compared to their diploid progenitors. We studied how established tetraploids differed from diploids compared to neotetraploids, to further learn about the fate of WGD-associated phenotypic effects during polyploid establishment. Results The short-term effects of WGD were an increase in size of morphological traits and cells, accompanied by a decrease in fitness and the number of cells. After establishment, the morphological effect persisted, but cellular and fitness components reverted back to the values observed in the diploid ancestors. Conclusions Our results suggest that the larger morphology of autotetraploids is not a constraint to establishment. However, other observable effects of genome doubling disappeared with time, suggesting that solving cellular and fitness constraints are critical aspects for polyploid establishment.},

Leaf mass per area, which is influenced by both leaf thickness and density (LMA\hspace{0.25em}=\hspace{0.25em}thickness\hspace{0.25em}\texttimes\hspace{0.25em}density), generally increases from the bottom to the top of tree canopies, yet the mechanisms behind this universal pattern are not yet resolved. For decades, the light environment was assumed to be the most influential driver of within-canopy variation in LMA, yet recent evidence has shown hydrostatic gradients to be more important in upper canopy positions, especially in tall evergreen trees in temperate and tropical forests. The aim of this study was to disentangle the importance of various environmental drivers on vertical LMA gradients in a mature sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) forest. We compared LMA, leaf density and leaf thickness relationships with height, light and predawn leaf water potential ({$\Psi$}Pre) within a closed and an exposed canopy to assess leaf morphological traits at similar heights but different light conditions. Contrary to our expectations and recent findings in the literature, we found strong evidence that light was the primary driver of vertical gradients in leaf morphology. At similar heights (13\textendash 23\hspace{0.25em}m), LMA was greater within the exposed canopy than the closed canopy, and light had a stronger influence over LMA compared with {$\Psi$}Pre. Light also had a stronger influence over both leaf thickness and density compared with {$\Psi$}Pre; however, the increase in LMA within both canopy types was primarily due to increasing leaf thickness with increasing light availability. This study provides strong evidence that canopy structure and crown exposure, in addition to height, should be considered as a parameter for determining vertical patterns in LMA and modeling canopy function.},

  abstract = {Within-canopy gradients of leaf functional traits have been linked to both light availability and vertical gradients in leaf water potential. While observational studies can reveal patterns in leaf traits, within-canopy experimental manipulations can provide mechanistic insight to tease apart multiple interacting drivers. Our objectives were to disentangle effects of height and light environment on leaf functional traits by experimentally shading branches along vertical gradients within a sugar maple (Acer saccharum) forest. Shading reduced leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf density, area-based leaf nitrogen (Narea), and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, and increased mass-based leaf nitrogen (Nmass), highlighting the importance of light availability on leaf morphology and chemistry. Early in the growing season, midday leaf water potential ({$\Psi$}mid), LMA, and Narea were driven primarily by height; later in the growing season, light became the most important driver for LMA and Narea. Carbon isotope composition ({$\delta$}13C) displayed strong, linear correlations with height throughout the growing season, but did not change with shading, implying that height is more influential than light on water use efficiency and stomatal behavior. LMA, leaf density, Nmass, C:N ratio, and {$\delta$}13C all changed seasonally, suggesting that leaf ageing effects on leaf functional traits are equally as important as microclimatic conditions. Overall, our results indicate that: (1) stomatal sensitivity to vapor pressure deficit or {$\Psi$}mid constrains the supply of CO2 to leaves at higher heights, independent of light environment, and (2) LMA and Narea distributions become functionally optimized through morphological acclimation to light with increasing leaf age despite height-related constraints.},

  abstract = {Current thinking in life-history theory and the biology of ageing suggests that ageing rates, and consequently life spans, evolve largely as a function of trade-offs with reproduction. While various evolutionary constraints are generally acknowledged to exist, their potential role in determining ageing rates is rarely considered. This review integrates three types of information to assess the relative importance of constraints and trade-offs in shaping ageing rates: (a) empirical work on the presence of intraspecific trade-offs; (b) theoretical work on factors limiting the force of trade-offs; and (c) consideration of the biological mechanisms of ageing, as currently understood. At the empirical level, evidence for intraspecific trade-offs is mixed, including some surprising failures to observe a trade-off in model organisms. At the theoretical level, the presence of multiple currencies and nonlinearity can weaken the strength and/or generality of trade-offs. Additionally, trade-offs among lower-level functions, such as between sources of mortality, can create constraints at higher organizational levels, for example such that reductions in reproduction are unable to produce decreases in ageing rate. In terms of ageing mechanisms, some mechanisms, such as the regulation of IGF-1 and related pathways, seem to agree quite well with trade-offs as a driving force; however, other mechanisms, such as dysregulation of the vertebrate stress response and stem cell exhaustion, seem more likely to impose constraints than to mediate trade-offs. Taken together, these findings suggest that trade-offs alone are insufficient to understand how ageing rates evolve; instead, both trade-offs and constraints likely play important roles in shaping evolutionary patterns, with their relative importance varying across taxa. Accordingly, it is time to revisit the broad assumption that survival\textendash reproduction trade-offs are the key force structuring much of life-history variation and the evolution of ageing rates.

Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient. We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions. We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils. We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.},

However, the underlying physiological mechanisms that link reproduction to survival are poorly understood, particularly in wild populations. 2. Previous experiments in the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) show that the elimination of reproduction via surgical ovariectomy results in a dramatic increase in the survival of wild females. We hypothesized that this trade-off reflects underlying differences in energy allocation between reproduction and physiological processes that influence survival. 3. To test this hypothesis, we compared ovariectomized (OVX) females to reproductive controls (SHAM) with respect to four physiological parameters that are thought to influence survival: energy storage, haematocrit, immune function and parasitemia. 4. Consistent with previous studies, we found that OVX females exhibited increased survival and growth relative to reproductive SHAM females. At the end of the breeding season, OVX also exceeded SHAM with respect to energy storage, haematocrit and immune response to phytohemagglutinin challenge. 5. Contrary to our predictions, OVX were more likely than SHAM to exhibit high levels of parasitemia. However, growth and parasite load were positively correlated in OVX and negatively correlated in SHAM, suggesting that reproductive investment may compromise parasite tolerance rather than parasite resistance. 6. Collectively, our results provide direct experimental evidence that reproductive investment affects several key physiological traits that likely interact to influence survival in wild populations.},

Differences in environmental stress between these sites drove the resulting differences in structural and physiological characteristics and leaf nutrient content of the investigated tree species. At the wet site, trees were more productive as site conditions allowed for greater photosynthetic activity to occur. The growth of pioneer tree species such as Spondias mombin, Guazuma ulmifolia, and Luehea seemanni, correlated strongly with high water-use efficiency and large, low-density leaves. Tree species, especially N-fixing species such as Albizia adinocephala, Albizia guachapele, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Gliricidia sepium, adapted to the greater levels of environmental stress at the dry site with infertile soils by increasing their water-use efficiency. Species differences were also significant, indicating that certain species adapted physiologically and structurally to environmental stress. Tree productivity operated under different structural and physiological constraints at each site. Leaf mass area (LMA), foliar N, and leaf area index (LAI) best predicted massbased net photosynthetic capacity at the more fertile, wet site while foliar N was the best predictor of mass-based net photosynthetic capacity at the less fertile, dry site. Results from this study suggest the use of pioneer species at wet, fertile sites and N-fixing species at dry, infertile sites for restoration projects.},

Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is one of these methods. Here we review the foundations of ABC, its recent algorithmic developments, and its applications in evolutionary biology and ecology. We argue that the use of ABC should incorporate all aspects of Bayesian data analysis: formulation, fitting, and improvement of a model. ABC can be a powerful tool to make inferences with complex models if these principles are carefully applied.},

  abstract = {1. Many recent statistical applications involve inference under complex models, where it is computationally prohibitive to calculate likelihoods but possible to simulate data. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is devoted to these complex models because it bypasses the evaluation of the likelihood function by comparing observed and simulated data. 2. We introduce the R package `abc' that implements several ABC algorithms for performing parameter estimation and model selection. In particular, the recently developed nonlinear heteroscedastic regression methods for ABC are implemented. The `abc' package also includes a cross-validation tool for measuring the accuracy of ABC estimates and to calculate the misclassification probabilities when performing model selection. The main functions are accompanied by appropriate summary and plotting tools. 3. R is already widely used in bioinformatics and several fields of biology. The R package `abc' will make the ABC algorithms available to a large number of R users. `abc' is a freely available R package under the GPL license, and it can be downloaded at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abc/index.html.},

  abstract = {ForestGEO is a network of scientists and long-term forest dynamics plots (FDPs) spanning the Earth's major forest types. ForestGEO's mission is to advance understanding of the diversity and dynamics of forests and to strengthen global capacity for forest science research. ForestGEO is unique among forest plot networks in its large-scale plot dimensions, censusing of all stems {$\geq$}1 cm in diameter, inclusion of tropical, temperate and boreal forests, and investigation of additional biotic (e.g., arthropods) and abiotic (e.g., soils) drivers, which together provide a holistic view of forest functioning. The 71 FDPs in 27 countries include approximately 7.33 million living trees and about 12,000 species, representing 20\% of the world's known tree diversity. With {$>$}1300 published papers, ForestGEO researchers have made significant contributions in two fundamental areas: species coexistence and diversity, and ecosystem functioning. Specifically, defining the major biotic and abiotic controls on the distribution and coexistence of species and functional types and on variation in species' demography has led to improved understanding of how the multiple dimensions of forest diversity are structured across space and time and how this diversity relates to the processes controlling the role of forests in the Earth system. Never\- theless, knowledge gaps remain that impede our ability to predict how forest diversity and function will respond to climate change and other stressors. Meeting these global research challenges requires major advances in standardizing taxonomy of tropical species, resolving the main drivers of forest dynamics, and integrating plotbased ground and remote sensing observations to scale up estimates of forest diversity and function, coupled with improved predictive models. However, they cannot be met without greater financial commitment to sustain the long-term research of ForestGEO and other forest plot networks, greatly expanded scientific capacity across the world's forested nations, and increased collaboration and integration among research networks and disciplines addressing forest science.},

As a result, individual variation in foraging rates may play an important role in determining the effects of predator-prey interactions on communities. Such variation in foraging rates stems from individual variation in traits that influence the mechanistic components of the functional response, such as movements that determine encounters and behaviors such as decisions to attack. However, we still have little information about individual-level variation in functional responses or the traits that give rise to such variation. Here we combine a standard functional response experiment with wolf spiders foraging on fruit flies with a novel analysis to connect individual morphology, physiology, and movement to individual foraging performance. We found substantial variation in traits between males and females, but these were not clearly linked to the differences in the functional response between males and females. Contrary to expectations, we found no effect of body velocity, leg length, energetic state, or metabolic rate on foraging performance. Instead, we found that body mass interacted with body rotations (clockwise turns), such that larger spiders showed higher foraging performance when they turned more but the reverse was true for smaller spiders. Our results highlight the need to understand the apparent complexity of the links between the traits of individuals and the functional response.},

However, it is widely observed that Na declines less rapidly than light in real plant canopies. Here we show that this general observation can be explained by optimal leaf acclimation to light subject to a lower-bound constraint on the leaf mass per area (ma). Using a simple model of the carbon\textendash nitrogen (C\textendash N) balance of trees with a steady-state canopy, we implement this constraint within the framework of the MAXX optimization hypothesis that maximizes net canopy C export. Virtually all canopy traits predicted by MAXX (leaf N gradient, leaf N concentration, leaf photosynthetic capacity, canopy N content, leaf-area index) are in close agreement with the values observed in a mature stand of Norway spruce trees (Picea abies L. Karst.). An alternative upperbound constraint on leaf photosynthetic capacity (Asat) does not reproduce the canopy traits of this stand. MAXX subject to a lower bound on ma is also qualitatively consistent with co-variations in leaf N gradient, ma and Asat observed across a range of temperate and tropical tree species. Our study highlights the key role of constraints in optimization models of plant function.},

  abstract = {Sverdrup's critical depth hypothesis, which has had an almost canonical status in biological oceanography, has recently been challenged as a universal explanation for the formation of oceanic spring blooms, and several alternative hypotheses have been proposed. Arguments pro and contra alternative explanations have so far relied on theoretical considerations and purely observational data. In this paper, we propose that mesocosm experiments with natural plankton communities could make important contributions to the resolution of the issue. We first briefly review the foundations of the critical depth concept and derive an approximate relationship that relates optically scaled critical depth ({$\frac{1}{4}$}``critical optical depth'', i.e. the product of the light attenuation coefficient and the critical depth) to light-dependent phytoplankton production in the mixed surface layer. We describe how this relationship can be used to scale experimental mesocosms such that they reproduce ambient light conditions of natural water columns from the surface down to the critical depth and beyond. We illustrate the power of the approach with a mesocosm study in which we experimentally controlled the onset of the spring bloom of a lake plankton community through the manipulation of optically scaled mixed-layer depth. This experiment may be the first experimental demonstration of the critical depth principle acting on a natural plankton community. Compensation light intensity ({$\frac{1}{4}$}minimum average mixed-layer light intensity required to trigger a bloom of the ambient plankton community) could be constrained to be somewhat above 3.2 moles PAR m22 d21, corresponding to a critical optical depth of 10.5. We compare these numbers to estimates from marine systems and end with a discussion of how experiments could be designed to (i) more accurately determine the critical depth in a given system and (ii) resolve among competing hypotheses for vernal bloom onset.},

This necessarily means that rare alleles that can be acted on by selection appear to experience high levels of frequency-dependence selection. However, selection may act on multiple traits at any one time.               Doebeli and Ispolatov               (p.               494               ) present a theoretical framework examining how multiple rare traits can persist and potentially drive speciation. The s show that only low levels of frequency-dependent selection are needed to explain the observed high levels of allelic diversity in nature.                        ,              Eco-evolutionary models of selection acting on multiple traits show how rare alleles can establish and drive speciation.           ,              The mechanisms for the origin and maintenance of biological diversity are not fully understood. It is known that frequency-dependent selection, generating advantages for rare types, can maintain genetic variation and lead to speciation, but in models with simple phenotypes (that is, low-dimensional phenotype spaces), frequency dependence needs to be strong to generate diversity. However, we show that if the ecological properties of an organism are determined by multiple traits with complex interactions, the conditions needed for frequency-dependent selection to generate diversity are relaxed to the point where they are easily satisfied in high-dimensional phenotype spaces. Mathematically, this phenomenon is reflected in properties of eigenvalues of quadratic forms. Because all living organisms have at least hundreds of phenotypes, this casts the potential importance of frequency dependence for the origin and maintenance of diversity in a new light.},

Links between LMA, LDMC and other leaf traits were analysed at the species and the community level using standardised major axis (SMA) regressions Results LMA and LDMC were significantly related to many leaf nutrient concentrations, but only when using abundance-weighted values at community level. Among-traits links were much weaker for the crossspecies analysis. Nitrogen isotopic signatures were useful to understand different resource-use strategies. Community-weighted LMA and LDMC were negatively related to light availability, contrary to what was expected. Conclusion Community leaf traits have parallel shifts along the environmental factors that determine the community assembly, even though they are weakly related across individual taxa. Light availability is the main environmental factor determining this convergence of the community leaf traits.},

Here we aimed to assess how their variation, within and between species, tracks environmental gradients. Measurements were made on 705 species from 116 sites within a broad north\textendash south transect from tropical to temperate Australia. Trait responses to environment were quantified using multiple regression; within- and between-species responses were compared using analysis of covariance and trait-gradient analysis. Leaf area, the leaf economics spectrum (indexed by LMA and Narea) and {$\chi$} (from stable carbon isotope ratios) varied almost independently among species. Across sites, however, {$\chi$} and LA increased with mean growing-season temperature (mGDD0) and decreased with vapour pressure deficit (mVPD0) and soil pH. LMA and Narea showed the reverse pattern. Climate responses agreed with expectations based on optimality principles. Within-species variability contributed {$<$} 10\% to geographical variation in LA but {$>$} 90\% for {$\chi$}, with LMA and Narea intermediate. These findings support the hypothesis that acclimation within individuals, adaptation within species and selection among species combine to create predictable relationships between traits and environment.

We used a large compilation of plant biomass and size observations, including observations of 21 084 individuals on 656 species. We used a combination of semiparametric methods and variance partitioning to test the influence of PFT, plant height, LMA, total leaf area, stem basal area and climate on above-ground biomass distribution. The ratio of leaf mass to above-ground woody mass (MF/MS) varied strongly among PFTs. We found that MF/MS at a given plant height was proportional to LMA across PFTs. As a result, the PFTs did not differ in the amount of leaf area supported per unit above-ground biomass or per unit stem basal area. Climate consistently explained very little additional variation in biomass distribution at a given plant size. Combined, these results demonstrate consistent patterns in above-ground biomass distribution and leaf area relationships among major woody PFTs, which can be used to further constrain global vegetation models.},

  abstract = {Cities are home to several species of pollinators that play an important role in the reproductive success of wild and cultivated plants that grow in these ecosystems and their surroundings. Pollution is a main driver of pollinator decline. Light and noise pollution are more intense in cities than in any other ecosystem. Although nocturnal pollinators are heavily exposed to these pollutants, their effect on bat pollination is still unknown. Our goal was to assess the effect of light and noise pollution on the main pollination components (pollinator visits, pollen transfer, pollen germination, fruit, and seed set) of the tropical tree, Ceiba pentandra, in a heavily urbanized ecosystem. We measured these components in sites with contrasting intensities of artificial light and anthropogenic noise and statistically assessed the direct and indirect effect of pollutants on pollination components using structural equation modeling. We found that noise and light pollution negatively affected the visits by the bats that pollinate C. pentandra. However, these negative effects did not affect posterior pollination components. In fact, the direct effect of light pollution on reproductive success was positive and greater than the indirect effects via pollinator visits. We suggest that illuminated trees may be able to sustain a large quantity of fruits and seeds because they produce more photosynthates due to greater light radiation and delayed leaf abscission. We conclude that, despite the negative effect of light and noise on pollinator visits, these pollutants did not significantly impact the reproductive success of C. pentandra.},

  abstract = {Trade-offs between functional traits are ubiquitous in nature and can promote species coexistence depending on their shape. Classic theory predicts that convex trade-offs facilitate coexistence of specialized species with extreme trait values (extreme species) while concave trade-offs promote species with intermediate trait values (intermediate species). We show here that this prediction becomes insufficient when the traits translate non-linearly into fitness which frequently occurs in nature, e.g., an increasing length of spines reduces grazing losses only up to a certain threshold resulting in a saturating or sigmoid trait-fitness function. We present a novel, general approach to evaluate the effect of different trade-off shapes on species coexistence. We compare the trade-off curve to the invasion boundary of an intermediate species invading the two extreme species. At this boundary, the invasion fitness is zero. Thus, it separates trait combinations where invasion is or is not possible. The invasion boundary is calculated based on measurable trait\textendash fitness relationships. If at least one of these relationships is not linear, the invasion boundary becomes non-linear, implying that convex and concave trade-offs not necessarily lead to different coexistence patterns. Therefore, we suggest a new ecological classification of trade-offs into extreme-favoring and intermediate-favoring which differs from a purely mathematical description of their shape. We apply our approach to a well-established model of an empirical predator\textendash prey system with competing prey types facing a trade-off between edibility and half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake. We show that the survival of the intermediate prey depends on the convexity of the trade-off. Overall, our approach provides a general tool to make a priori predictions on the outcome of competition among species facing a common trade-off in dependence of the shape of the trade-off and the shape of the trait\textendash fitness relationships.},

To these ends, experimental stemwood production data from 2012 to 2017 from eight Eucalyptus clones distributed over 23 locations with contrasting environmental conditions in Brazil were used. The APSIM Next Generation Eucalyptus model, when properly adapted and calibrated, performed well in simulating stemwood biomass and volume, basal area and leaf area index in subtropical and tropical regions and for different genetic entries. For stemwood biomass, the R2 ranged from 0.76 to 0.93 and the Willmott Agreement Index ranged from 0.93 to 0.98, indicating satisfactory precision and accuracy, respectively. As the model performed well, it may be a valuable decision support tool to help foresters in matching suitable genotypes to their sites, to simulate the best management strategies and to assist in long-term forest planning.},

  abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is now an established technique for statistical inference used in cases where the likelihood function is computationally expensive or not available. It relies on the use of a model that is specified in the form of a simulator, and approximates the likelihood at a parameter value \texttheta{} by simulating auxiliary data sets x and evaluating the distance of x from the true data y. However, ABC is not computationally feasible in cases where using the simulator for each \texttheta{} is very expensive. This article investigates this situation in cases where a cheap, but approximate, simulator is available. The approach is to employ delayed acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo within an ABC sequential Monte Carlo sampler to, in a first stage of the kernel, use the cheap simulator to rule out parts of the parameter space that are not worth exploring, so that the ``true'' simulator is only run (in the second stage of the kernel) where there is a reasonable chance of accepting proposed values of \texttheta. We show that this approach can be used quite automatically, with few tuning parameters. Applications to stochastic differential equation models and latent doubly intractable distributions are presented. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Disparities in nutrient content (nitrogen and phosphorus) between herbivores and their plant resources have lately proven to have major consequences for herbivore success, consumer-driven nutrient cycling, and the fate of primary production in ecosystems. Here we extend these findings by examining patterns of nutrient content between animals at higher trophic levels, specifically between insect herbivores and predators. Using a recently compiled database on insect nutrient content, we found that predators exhibit on average 15\% greater nitrogen content than herbivores. This difference persists after accounting for variation from phylogeny and allometry. Among herbivorous insects, we also found evidence that recently derived lineages (e.g., herbivorous Diptera and Lepidoptera) have, on a relative basis, 15\%\textendash 25\% less body nitrogen than more ancient herbivore lineages (e.g., herbivorous Orthoptera and Hemiptera). We elaborate several testable hypotheses for the origin of differences in nitrogen content between trophic levels and among phylogenetic lineages. For example, interspecific variation in insect nitrogen content may be directly traceable to differences in dietary nitrogen (including dilution by gut contents), selected for directly in response to the differential scarcity of dietary nitrogen, or an indirect consequence of adaptation to different feeding habits. From some functional perspectives, the magnitude rather than the source of the interspecific differences in nitrogen content may be most critical. We conclude by discussing the implications of the observed patterns for both the trophic complexity of food webs and the evolutionary radiation of herbivorous insects.},

  abstract = {The trade-offs between tree growth and mortality are important indicators of the life-history strategies of species and have been demonstrated to be maintained by inherent fitness differences among species. There is a growing consensus that functional traits which inflect the ecological performances of individuals may be correlated with growth\textendash mortality trade-offs within communities. In this study, the aforementioned trade-offs were detected and their relationships with the functional traits were examined, based on data collected in a typical temperate forested area in northeastern China. Principal components analyses were performed for growth\textendash mortality trade-off relationships. The factor scores on the first principal component were used to represent the species' positions at an axis of life-history variations among different species. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were performed for the purpose of detecting the relationships between functional traits and the growth\textendash mortality trade-off. The results showed that there were significant trade-offs between the tree growth and mortality rates in the examined plot. Among the six functional traits which were considered, the H\- max was found to have the strongest effects on the demographic rates and trade-offs. The observed negative effects on the tree growth and mortality rates suggested that the large species often grow more slowly and living longer, while species at small adult size grow fast but die easily. It was also observed that the specific leaf area and the leaf carbon content level were also very important to the growth and mortality trade-offs. The traits considered in this study explained 68\% of interspecific variations in the species positions in the growth\textendash mortality trade-off. In addition, wood density was found to show no effect on the trade-off. This was likely due to the fact that the density of the wood may influence the demographic rates more strongly during the early life stages of the trees. The results of discrimination analysis further confirmed the explanations abilities of the functional traits on the variations of life-history strategies among the species. Due to the fact that the relationships between the functional traits and the trade-offs were found to be relatively variable, it will be necessary to further consider other traits which are more closely and mechanistically linked to individual performances in future investigations, such as leaf life span, leaf tissue density, photosynthetic capacity, and dark respiration rates.},

  abstract = {We introduce an Interaction- and Trade-off-based Eco-Evolutionary Model (ITEEM), in which species are competing in a well-mixed system, and their evolution in interaction trait space is subject to a life-history trade-off between replication rate and competitive ability. We demonstrate that the shape of the trade-off has a fundamental impact on eco-evolutionary dynamics, as it imposes four phases of diversity, including a sharp phase transition. Despite its minimalism, ITEEM produces a remarkable range of patterns of eco-evolutionary dynamics that are observed in experimental and natural systems. Most notably we find self-organization towards structured communities with high and sustained diversity, in which competing species form interaction cycles similar to rock-paper-scissors games., A patch of rain forest, a coral reef, a pond, and the microbes in our guts are all examples of biological communities. More generally, a community is a group of organisms that live together at the same place and time. Many communities are composed of a large number of different species, and this diversity is maintained for long times., Although diversity is a key feature of biological communities, the mechanisms that generate and maintain diversity are not well understood. Research had hinted at links between diversity and the trade-offs that species are subject to. For instance, there is a trade-off between competitiveness and reproduction: if there are limited resources in the environment a species may either produce many offspring that are not very competitive, or fewer, more competitive offspring., Farahpour et al. have now simulated the development of communities of organisms that reproduce, compete, and die in a uniform environment. Crucially, these computational simulations introduced a trade-off between competitive ability and reproduction., The simulations show that the form of trade-off has a fundamental impact on diversity: moderate trade-offs favor diversity, whereas extreme trade-offs suppress diversity. The simulations also revealed mechanisms that underlie how diversity is generated. In particular, cyclic relationships emerge where one species dominates another but is also dominated by a third, similar to the rock-paper-scissors game., Since Farahpour et al. used a bare-bone model with only a few essential features the results could apply to a larger class of community-like systems whose evolution is driven by competition. This includes economic and social systems as well as biological communities.},

Speciation is the process primarily responsible for this great diversity of life. Here, we summarize our current understanding of speciation and highlight some of the important factors and mechanisms involved in the process. We begin by defining the speciation problem as one involving the evolution of barriers to genetic exchange between populations, with the product being differentiated species that maintain their distinction if, when, and where they happen to co-occur. We then categorize the major different types of barriers to genetic exchange and outline several different modes of speciation (largely geographically defined) under which these barriers can evolve. We next elaborate on different mechanisms that can underlie the evolution of reproductive isolation and the formation of new species. We conclude by discussing future avenues of research, including the study of the genomics of speciation and new developments in the field.},

Microbiologists should be aware that all of these traits are subject to constraints imposed by trade-offs, so adaptations improving one trait may be at the cost of another. A deeper appreciation of trade-offs is thus crucial for assessing the mechanistic limits on important bacterial characteristics. Studies of the negative correlations between various traits have revealed three molecular mechanisms, namely, trade-offs involving resource allocation, design constraint, and information processing. This review further discusses why these trade-off mechanisms are important in the establishment of models capable of predicting bacterial competition, coexistence, and sources of diversity.},

  abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has gained popularity over the past few years for the analysis of complex models arising in population genetics, epidemiology and system biology. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches have become work-horses in ABC. Here we discuss how to construct the perturbation kernels that are required in ABC SMC approaches, in order to construct a sequence of distributions that start out from a suitably defined prior and converge towards the unknown posterior. We derive optimality criteria for different kernels, which are based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a distribution and the distribution of the perturbed particles. We will show that for many complicated posterior distributions, locally adapted kernels tend to show the best performance. We find that the added moderate cost of adapting kernel functions is easily regained in terms of the higher acceptance rate. We demonstrate the computational efficiency gains in a range of toy examples which illustrate some of the challenges faced in real-world applications of ABC, before turning to two demanding parameter inference problems in molecular biology, which highlight the huge increases in efficiency that can be gained from choice of optimal kernels. We conclude with a general discussion of the rational choice of perturbation kernels in ABC SMC settings.},

  abstract = {Insects contain significant amounts of fiber as measured by crude fiber, acid detergent fiber (ADF) or neutral detergent fiber (NDF). It has always been assumed that the fiber in insects represents chitin based on the structural similarity between cellulose and chitin and the fact that the ADF fraction from insects contains nitrogen. In this study, a number of insect species that are raised commercially as food for insectivores were analyzed for moisture, crude protein (nitrogen \texttimes{} 6.25), fat, ash, NDF, ADF, and amino acids. Additionally, the ADF fraction was analyzed for nitrogen and amino acids to determine if proteins might be present in the ADF fraction. The ADF fraction contained a significant amount of amino acids accounting for 9.3\textendash 32.7\% of the ADF (by weight). The presence of amino acids in the ADF fraction means that using ADF to estimate insect chitin results in an overestimation of insect chitin content. Using ADF adjusted for its amino acid content, the estimated chitin content of these insect species ranged from 2.7\textendash 49.8 mg/kg (as is) and 11.6\textendash 137.2 mg/kg (dry matter basis). Additionally, these data suggest that for the species measured here the amount of chitin nitrogen is quite small (as a \% of total nitrogen) and that crude protein (nitrogen \texttimes{} 6.25) provides a reasonable estimate of the true protein for most species of insects.

Soldier fly larvae, Turkestan cockroach nymphs, tebo worms, and adult house flies were analyzed for moisture, protein, fat, ash, acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and selected carotenoids. The acid detergent fiber was analyzed for amino acids to estimate chitin content. Nutrient content varied widely between the four insect species. Ranges for the macronutrients were as follows: moisture (60.2\textendash 74.8\%), crude protein (15.5\textendash 19.7\%), crude fat (1.9\%\textendash 29.4\%), acid detergent fiber (1.4\textendash 3.0\%), neutral detergent fiber (2.6\textendash 3.8\%), and ash (0.8\textendash 3.5\%). Energy content ranged from a low of 918 kcal/kg for house flies to 2,977 kcal/kg for tebo worms. The chitin content of these four species ranged from 6.7 to 21.0 mg/kg. The nutrients most likely to be deficient when these species of insects are used as food for insectivores are vitamin A, vitamin D, calcium, vitamin E, thiamine, iodine, and vitamin B12. The number of nutrients deficient vs. the NRC requirements for rats on an energy basis by insect species was as follows: soldier fly larvae (3), tebo worms (15), Turkestan cockroach nymphs (5), and adult house flies (6). These data are valuable in helping assess the nutrient intake of captive insectivores and in developing gut-loading diets to improve the nutrient intake of captive insectivores.

This ``worldwide leaf economics spectrum'' consists of a suite of intercorrelated leaf traits, among which leaf mass per area, LMA, is one of the most fundamental as it indicates the cost of leaf construction and light-interception borne by plants. We conducted a broad-scale analysis of the evolutionary history of LMA across a large dataset of 5401 vascular plant species. The phylogenetic signal in LMA displayed low but significant conservatism, that is, leaf economics tended to be more similar among close relatives than expected by chance alone. Models of trait evolution indicated that LMA evolved under weak stabilizing selection. Moreover, results suggest that different optimal phenotypes evolved among large clades within which extremes tended to be selected against. Conservatism in LMA was strongly related to growth form, as were selection intensity and phenotypic evolutionary rates: woody plants showed higher conservatism in relation to stronger stabilizing selection and lower evolutionary rates compared to herbaceous taxa. The evolutionary history of LMA thus paints different evolutionary trajectories of vascular plant species across clades, revealing the coordination of leaf trait evolution with growth forms in response to varying selection regimes.},

ALAN can have a suite of effects on community structure and is a driver of evolutionary processes that influences a range of behavioral and physiological traits. Our understanding of possible effects of ALAN across species amphibians is lacking and research is warranted as ALAN could contribute to stress and declines of amphibian populations, particularly in urban areas. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to constant light or pulsed ALAN would physiologically stress Rio Grande leopard frog (Rana berlandieri) and Gulf Coast toad (Bufo valliceps) tadpoles. We reared tadpoles under constant or pulsed (on and off again) ALAN for 14 days and measured corticosterone release rates over time using a non-invasive water-borne hormone protocol. ALAN treatments did not affect behavior or growth. Tadpoles of both species had higher corticosterone (cort) release rates after 14 days of constant light exposure. Leopard frog tadpoles had lower cort release rates after exposure to pulsed ALAN while toad tadpoles had higher cort release rates. These results suggest that short-term exposure to constant or pulsed light at night may contribute to stress in tadpoles but that each species differentially modulated their cort response to ALAN exposure and a subsequent stressor. This flexibility in the upregulation and downregulation of hypothalamicpituitary-interrenal axis response may indicate an alternative mechanism for diminishing the deleterious effects of chronic stress. Nonetheless, ALAN should be considered in management and conservation plans for amphibians.},

We are positioned to evaluate potential long-term consequences of nutrient addition in central Panama where we have maintained a factorial nitrogen\textendash phosphorus\textendash potassium fertilization experiment for 21 yr and an independent study quantified the species-specific nutrient requirements of 550 local tree species. Here, we ask whether nutrients limit reproduction at the species and community levels. We also ask whether species-specific reproductive responses to nutrient addition are stronger among species associated with naturally fertile soils, which could contribute to a shift in species composition. We quantified species-level reproductive responses for 38 focal species in the 21st year of the experiment and community-level reproductive litter production for the first 20 yr. Species-level reproductive responses to nitrogen and potassium addition were weak, inconsistent across species, and insignificant across the 38 focal species. In contrast, species-level responses to phosphorus addition were consistently and significantly positive across the 38 focal species but were unrelated to species-specific phosphorus requirements documented independently for the same species. Community-level reproductive litter production was unaffected by nutrient addition, possibly because spatial and temporal variation is large. We conclude that phosphorus limits reproduction by trees in our experiment but find no evidence that reproductive responses to phosphorus addition favor species associated with naturally phosphorus-rich soils.},

  abstract = {The light-dependent generation of active oxygen species is termed photooxidative stress. This can occur in two ways: (1) the donation of energy or electrons directly to oxygen as a result of photosynthetic activity; (2) exposure of tissues to ultraviolet irradiation. The light-dependent destruction of catalase compounds the problem. Although generally detrimental to metabolism, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide may serve useful functions if rigorously controlled and compartmentalised. During photosynthesis the formation of active oxygen species is minimised by a number of complex and refined regulatory mechanisms. When produced, active oxygen species are eliminated rapidly by efficient antioxidative systems. The chloroplast is able to use the production and destruction of hydrogen peroxide to regulate the thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy. This is an intrinsic feature of the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport. Photoinhibition and photooxidation only usually occur when plants are exposed to stress. Active oxygen species are part of the alarm-signalling processes in plants. These serve to modify metabolism and gene expression so that the plant can respond to adverse environmental conditions, invading organisms and ultraviolet irradiation. The capacity of the antioxidative defense system is often increased at such times but if the response is not sufficient, radical production will exceed scavenging and ultimately lead to the disruption of metabolism. Oxidative damage arises in high light principally when the latter is in synergy with additional stress factors such as chilling temperatures or pollution. Environmental stress can modify the photooxidative processes in various ways ranging from direct involvement in light-induced free radical formation to the inhibition of metabolism that renders previously optimal light levels excessive. It is in just such situations that the capacity for the production of active oxygen species can exceed that for scavenging by the antioxidative defense systems. The advent of plant transformation, however, may have placed within our grasp the possibility of engineering greater stress tolerance in plants by enhancement of the antioxidative defence system.},

We use this approach to better understand the composition of a community of winter annual plants with multiple decades of monitoring and detailed morphological, phenological and physiological measurements. Previous research on this system revealed a physiological trade-off among dominant species that accurately predicts population and community dynamics. Here we expanded our investigation to 51 species, representing 96\% of individual plants recorded over 30 years, and analysed trait relationships in the context of species abundance and phylogenetic relationships. We found that the functional-trait trade-off scales to the entire community, albeit with diminished strength. It is strongest for dominant species and weakens as progressively rarer species are included. The trade-off has been consistently expressed over three decades of environmental change despite some turnover in the identity of dominant species.},

We quantified trade-offs between growth and survival for trees and lianas on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama using first-year seedlings of 22 liana and 31 tree species and saplings (10 mm {$\leq$} dbh {$\leq$} 39 mm) of 30 tree species. Lianas showed trade-offs similar to those of trees, with both groups exhibiting broadly overlapping ranges in survival and relative growth rates as seedlings. Life history strategies at the seedling stage were highly correlated with those at the sapling stage among tree species, with all species showing an increase in survival with size. Only one of 30 tree species demonstrated a statistically significant ontogenetic shift, having a relatively lower survival rate at the sapling stage than expected. Our results indicate that similar life history trade-offs apply across two functional groups (lianas and trees), and that life history strategies are largely conserved across seedling and sapling life-stages for most tropical tree species.},

Canopy structural parameters are usually described using several pseudo-synonymous terms, often measuring different components of vegetation canopies. Standardization in the definitions has fallen short, leading to confusion of terms even in standard text books making the comparison of historic measures futile. Here we clarify concepts that have been used for fractional canopy element cover and openness measures. The fractional canopy element cover and openness concepts considered are canopy closure, canopy cover, canopy openness, crown closure, crown completeness, crown cover, crown porosity, site openness and tilt openness. New methodologies are presented to obtain large scale fractional canopy element cover and openness measures using hemispherical photography. The new methodologies and variations in definitions of fractional canopy element cover and openness concepts are demonstrated using photographic measurements in complex topography. The results indicate that both fractional canopy element cover and openness parameters can be estimated with a few point-based measurements using hemispherical photography. Hemispherical photography is therefore less time, labour and resource intensive, as compared to point based measuring techniques of canopy element cover and openness. Most of the commonly and interchangeably used concepts of fractional canopy element cover and openness measures represent physically different structural properties of a vegetated ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Question Ecologists are increasingly interested in making accurate predictions of plant response to climate change. Many studies have attempted to document plant response to warming by grouping species into functional groups. Within functional groups, however, species often display divergent responses. Determining how foliar functional traits might be used to predict plant responses to warming could reduce analytical complexity while maintaining generalizations across systems. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis on 18 studies (consisting of 38 species) of plant biomass response to experimental or natural warming. We determined whether plant trait estimates associated with the leaf economics spectrum [leaf life span (LL), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen (Nmass), leaf phosphorus (Pmass), photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and stomatal conductance (Gs)] from a global plant database of experimentally unmanipulated plants, GloPNet, could be used to predict biomass response to experimental warming. Results We found that three single leaf traits (LL, Nmass and Amax) were significant predictors for the response of plant biomass to warming treatments, perhaps due to their association with plant growth rates, adaptation rate and ability, each explaining between 21\textendash 46\% of the variation in plant biomass responses. The magnitude of response to warming decreased with increasing LL, but increased with increasing Nmass and Amax. We found no linear combination of any of these traits that predicted warming response. Conclusions These results show that foliar traits can aid in understanding the mechanisms by which plants respond to temperature across species. Because each trait only explained a portion of variation in how plant growth responded to warming, however, future studies that examine how plant communities respond to warming should simultaneously measure multiple leaf traits, especially those most sensitive to warming, across plant species, to determine whether the predictive ability of functional traits changes between different ecosystems or plant taxonomic groups.},

In contrast to this assumption there is a large body of evidence showing that juvenile growth rates may vary adaptively both within and between populations. This adaptive variation implies that high growth rates may be associated with costs. 2. Here, I explicitly evaluate the often-proposed trade-off between growth rate and predation risk, in a study of the temperate butterfly, Pararge aegeria (L). 3. By rearing larvae with a common genetic background in different photoperiods it was possible to experimentally manipulate larval growth rates, which vary in response to photoperiod. Predation risk was assessed by exposing larvae that were freely moving on their host plants to the predatory heteropteran, Picromerus bidens (L.). 4. The rate of predation was significantly higher in the fast-growing larvae. An approximately four times higher relative growth rate was associated with a 30\% higher daily predation risk. 5. The main result demonstrates a trade-off between growth rate and predation risk, and there are reasons to believe that this trade-off is of general significance in free-living animals. The results also suggest that juvenile development of P. aegeria is governed by a strategic decision process within individuals.},

  abstract = {1 It is useful to distinguish between the immediate effects of species richness on ecosystems and those which become apparent on a longer time scale, described here as filter and founder effects. 2 Relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties can be explored by classifying component species into three categories \textendash{} dominants, subordinates and transients. Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence; a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A `mass ratio' theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.},

Here, we compiled traits related to drought tolerance and the fast-slow and stature-recruitment trade-off axes in 601 tropical woody species to explore their covariations and phylogenetic signals. We found that xylem resistance to embolism (P50) determines the risk of hydraulic failure, while the functional significance of leaf turgor loss point (TLP) relies on its coordination with water use strategies. P50 and TLP exhibit weak phylogenetic signals and substantial variation within genera. TLP is closely associated with the fast-slow trait axis: slow species maintain leaf functioning under higher water stress. P50 is associated with both the fast-slow and stature-recruitment trait axes: slow and small species exhibit more resistant xylem. Lower leaf phosphorus concentration is associated with more resistant xylem, which suggests a (nutrient and drought) stress-tolerance syndrome in the tropics. Overall, our results imply that (1) drought tolerance is under strong selective pressure in tropical forests, and TLP and P50 result from the repeated evolutionary adaptation of closely related taxa, and (2) drought tolerance is coordinated with the ecological strategies governing tropical forest demography. These findings provide a physiological basis to interpret the drought-induced shift toward slow-growing, smaller, denser-wooded trees observed in the tropics, with implications for forest restoration programmes.},

We highlight some of the difficulties with the proposed solutions, and demonstrate that standard quantitative genetic theory and software offer solutions. We also show how results from Bayesian quantitative genetics can be used to create efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for phylogenetic mixed models, thereby extending their generality to non-Gaussian data. Of particular utility is the development of multinomial models for analysing the evolution of discrete traits, and the development of multi-trait models in which traits can follow different distributions. Meta-analyses often include a nonrandom collection of species for which the full phylogenetic tree has only been partly resolved. Using missing data theory, we show how the presented models can be used to correct for nonrandom sampling and show how taxonomies and phylogenies can be combined to give a flexible framework with which to model dependence.},

This paper extends the traditional methodology to incorporate multiple noncommensurate objective functions and use of the conditional expected value of the risk of extreme and catastrophic events. The proposed methodology considers the cases where (a) a finite number of actions are available at each decision node and (b) discrete or continuous states of nature can be presented at each chance node. The proposed extension of decision-tree analysis is introduced through an example problem that leads the reader step-by-step into the methodological procedure. The example problem builds on flood warning systems. Two noncommensurate objectives\textemdash the loss of lives and the loss of property (including monetary costs of the flood warning system)\textendash are incorporated into the decision tree. In addition, two risk measures\textemdash the common expected value and the conditional expected value of extreme and catastrophic events\textemdash are quantified and are also incorporated into the decision-making process. Theoretical difficulties associated with the stage-wise calculation of conditional expected values are identified and certain simplifying assumptions are made for computational tractibility. In particular, it is revealed that decisions concerning experimentation have a very interesting impact on the noninferior solution set of options\textemdash a phenomenon that has no equivalence in the single-objective case.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 915\textendash 935 Abstract Fitness costs of reproduction play a key role in understanding the evolution of reproductive tactics. Nevertheless, the detection and the intensity of costs of reproduction vary according to which life-history traits and species are studied. We propose an evolutionary model demonstrating that the chance of detecting a cost of reproduction should be lower when the fitness component studied has a low rather than high variance. Consequently, the fitness component that is affected the most by costs of reproduction should vary with life speed. Since long-lived species have developed a strategy that avoids jeopardizing their survival and short-lived species favour current reproduction, variance in survival is smaller and variance in reproduction higher in long-lived vs. short-lived species. We review empirical studies of costs of reproduction in free-ranging mammals, comparing evidence of costs reported among species and focal traits. In support of our model, more studies reported evidence of reproductive costs of reproduction in ungulates than in rodents, whereas survival costs of reproduction were more frequent in rodents than in ungulates. The life-history model we propose is expected to apply to any species, and hence provides a better understanding of life-history variation, which should be relevant to all evolutionary ecologists.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

In principle, higher mechanical resistance achieved via higher relative allocation to cell walls should slow photosynthetic rates. However, interspecific relationships among these two leaf functions have not been reported. We measured leaf traits of 57 dominant woody species in a subtropical evergreen forest in China, focusing especially on photosynthetic rates, mechanical properties, and leaf lifespan (LLS). These species were assigned to two ecological strategy groups: shade-tolerant species and light-demanding species. On average, shade-tolerant species had longer LLS, higher leaf mechanical strength but lower photosynthetic rates, and exhibited longer LLS for a given leaf mass per area (LMA) or mechanical strength than light-demanding species. Depending on the traits and the basis of expression (per area or per mass), leaf mechanical resistance and photosynthetic capacity were either deemed unrelated, or only weakly negatively correlated. We found only weak support for the proposed trade-off between leaf biomechanics and photosynthesis among co-occurring woody species. This suggests there is considerable flexibility in these properties, and the observed relationships may result more so from trait coordination than any physically or physiologically enforced trade-off.},

However, studies on effects of aboveground herbivory on root morphology are scarce and until now no study tested herbivory effects under natural conditions for a large set of plant species. Therefore, in a field experiment on plant\textendash soil interactions, I investigated the effect of aboveground insect herbivory on root morphological traits of 20 grassland plant species. For 9 of the 20 species, all individuals showed shoot damage in the presence of insect herbivores, but no damage in insect herbivore exclusions. In these 9 species root biomass increased and root morphological traits changed under herbivory towards thinner roots with increased specific root surface. In contrast, the remaining species did not differ in the number of individuals damaged, root biomass nor morphological traits with herbivores present vs. absent. The fact that aboveground herbivory resulted in thinner roots with increased specific root surface area for all species in which the herbivore exclusion manipulation altered shoot damage might indicate that plants increase nutrient uptake in response to herbivory. However, more importantly, results provide empirical evidence that aboveground herbivory impacts root morphological traits of plants. As these traits are important for the occupation of soil space, uptake processes, decomposition and interactions with soil biota, results suggest that herbivory-induced changes in root morphology might be of importance for plant\textendash soil feedbacks and plant\textendash plant competition.},

We analyzed the relationship between 10 leaf functional traits (LFTs) and 17 soil properties including soil nutrients, transformation flows and pH along a plant chronosequence spanning first 40 years of ESS in a tropical mountain cloud forest. To recognize the multivariate variation of soil properties, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. The first axis of PCA was mainly associated with soil pH, P, Ca, Mg, K, C:N and N transformation flow, and this first axis was tightly associated with vegetation ages. The community weighted mean of the LFTs was also associated with vegetation ages. In particular, leaf P declined while leaf density, C, C:P and N:P increased with vegetation ages. Our analyses suggest associations between soil properties (the first axis of the PCA) and the LFTs (leaf area, leaf thickness, leaf density, leaf C, leaf C:P and leaf N:P) over the plant chronosequence. A fast acquisition strategy was observed in the younger sites and a resource conservation strategy in the older sites.

We investigated the pattern of photosynthetic phosphorus-use efficiency (PPUE) in comparison with photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE) along gradients of P and N availability across biomes with 340 tree and shrub species. We used both total soil N and P concentration and foliar N/P ratios for indicating nutrient-availability gradients. 3. Photosynthetic phosphorus-use efficiency increased with greater leaf mass per area (LMA) toward decreasing P availability. By contrast, PNUE decreased with greater LMA towards decreasing N and P availability. 4. The increase in PPUE with decreasing P availability was caused by the net effects of a relatively greater reduction in foliar P concentration and a relatively constant photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate. The decrease in PNUE with decreasing N availability was caused by the effects of a reduction in photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate with greater LMA. 5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that higher PPUE may be an effective leaf-level adaptation to P-poor soils, especially in tropical tree species. Future research should focus on the difference between PPUE and PNUE in relation to leaf economics, physiology and strategy.},

For the same PFD, nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components was similar in both species, except for leaves of C. album grown at 5\% PFD, which showed a markedly smaller fraction of nitrogen in photosystem I. 3. Optimal nitrogen partitioning among photosynthetic components was estimated for various PFDs using a simulation model of leaf photosynthesis. At any PFD, the actual nitrogen partitioning was very similar to the estimated optimal partitioning. However, partitioning in C. album grown at 5\% PFD deviated from the optimum. 4. For both species grown under any light conditions, estimated daily photosynthesis of actual leaves was very close to that of leaves with optimal partitioning.

Currently, the physical link between forest albedo and productivity is poorly understood, yet it is crucial for designing optimal forest management strategies for mitigating climate change. We investigated the relationships between boreal forest structure, albedo and FAPAR using a radiative transfer model called Forest Reflectance and Transmittance model FRT and extensive forest inventory data sets ranging from southern boreal forests to the northern tree line in Finland and Alaska (N\,\,=\,\,1086~plots). The forests in the study areas vary widely in structure, species composition, and human interference, from intensively managed in Finland to natural growth in Alaska. We show that FAPAR of tree canopies (FAPARCAN) and albedo are tightly linked in boreal coniferous forests, but the relationship is weaker if the forest has broadleaved admixture, or if canopies have low leaf area and the composition of forest floor varies. Furthermore, the functional shape of the relationship between albedo and FAPARCAN depends on the angular distribution of incoming solar irradiance. We also show that forest floor can contribute to over 50\,\% of albedo or total ecosystem FAPAR. Based on our simulations, forest albedos can vary notably across the biome. Because of larger proportions of broadleaved trees, the studied plots in Alaska had higher albedo (0.141\textendash 0.184) than those in Finland (0.136\textendash 0.171) even though the albedo of pure coniferous forests was lower in Alaska. Our results reveal that variation in solar angle will need to be accounted for when evaluating climate effects of forest management in different latitudes. Furthermore, increasing the proportion of broadleaved trees in coniferous forests is the most important means of maximizing albedo without compromising productivity: based on our findings the potential of controlling forest density (i.e., basal area) to increase albedo may be limited compared to the effect of favoring broadleaved species.},

We explore the mechanistic basis for this trade-off and assess the relationship in the light of other prominent theories for allometric biomass partitioning. We show algebraically how the allocation of mass to leaves versus stems and the density of stem tissue can potentially influence this trade-off. To assess these possible effects, we compared the relationship between leaf size and leafing intensity, expressed on both mass and volume basis, at the level of a single branch as well as the entire above-ground plant in 61 forbs over a 3-year period. Our results support the idea that the trade-off between leaf size and volume-based leafing intensity depends on both biomass investment (leaves vs. stems) and stem bulk density (mass vs. volume), whereas the trade-off between leaf size and mass-based leafing intensity only depends on the biomass investment. Similar exponents in the scaling of leaf mass vs. stem mass and stem mass vs. stem volume at branch and whole plant levels lead to similar trade-offs. An isometric trade-off between leaf size and volume-based leafing intensity is consistent with a constant biomass partitioning between leaves and stems as well as constant stem tissue density. Conversely, an allometric trade-off between leaf size and volume-based leafing intensity arises when biomass allocation is allometric and stem bulk density varies with plant size.},

In the theory, this fundamental biodiversity number, together with the migration or dispersal rate, completely determines the steady-state distribution of species richness and relative species abundance on local to large geographic spatial scales and short-term to evolutionary time scales. Although neutral, Hubbell's theory is nevertheless able to generate many nonobvious, testable, and remarkably accurate quantitative predictions about biodiversity and biogeography. In many ways Hubbell's theory is the ecological analog to the neutral theory of genetic drift in genetics. The unified neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity should stimulate research in new theoretical and empirical directions by ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and biogeographers.},

These tradeoffs have profound implications in agriculture and natural ecosystems, as both processes are vital for plant survival, reproduction, and, ultimately, plant fitness. While many of the molecular mechanisms underlying growth and defense tradeoffs remain to be elucidated, hormone crosstalk has emerged as a major player in regulating tradeoffs needed to achieve a balance. In this review, we cover recent advances in understanding growth\textendash defense tradeoffs in plants as well as what is known regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms. Specifically, we address evidence supporting the growth\textendash defense tradeoff concept, as well as known interactions between defense signaling and growth signaling. Understanding the molecular basis of these tradeoffs in plants should provide a foundation for the development of breeding strategies that optimize the growth\textendash defense balance to maximize crop yield to meet rising global food and biofuel demands.},

  abstract = {1. Tree architecture is thought to allow species to partition horizontal and vertical light gradients in the forest canopy. Tree architecture is closely related to light capture, carbon gain and the efficiency with which trees reach the canopy. Previous studies that investigated how light gradients drive differentiation in tree architecture have produced inconsistent results, partially because of the differences in which tree species and ontogenetic stages were studied. 2. We examined the relationship between stem diameter, tree height, foliage height, crown width and life-history strategy over a broad size range of 200 randomly selected, co-occurring tree species in a lowland rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to account for both intra- and interspecific variation and describe the relationships among tree architectural variables. We analysed interspecific variation in tree architectural variables in relation to adult stature and light requirement for species regeneration as a function of tree size. 3. There was little interspecific variation in architectural variables, this is partly because of large intraspecific variation in response to canopy heterogeneity, but it also suggests architectural convergence within this community. However, interspecific analyses showed that, for large-statured species, small size classes had thinner stems with narrow and shallow crowns, whereas large-size classes had wider crowns. Light-demanding species (as indicated by high sapling mortality in shaded conditions) showed weak trends in tree architecture and were only characterized by wide crowns at intermediate sizes. 4. In summary, tree architectural traits overlapped across the species community. This suggests that architectural convergence and equalizing effects occur in this diverse tropical forest and that community-wide allometric equations can be used to describe forest height and carbon storage. Light resource partitioning also occurs, indicating stabilizing effects. Interspecific architectural variation in relation to adult stature supports the theory of the trade-off between early reproduction and vegetative growth. In closed rainforests, adult stature imposes a stronger force on architectural differentiation of species than regeneration light requirements.},

Theoretical work has shown that the precise shape of a trade-off relationship affects evolutionary predictions. One common trade-off is that between competitive ability and resistance to predators, parasitoids, pathogens or herbivores. We used a microbial experimental system to elucidate the shape of the relationship between parasitoid resistance and competitive ability. For each of 86 bacteriophage-resistant isolates of the bacterium Escherichia coli B, we measured the degree of resistance to bacteriophage T2 (a viral parasitoid) and relative competitive ability in both the resource environment in which strains were isolated and in two alternate environments. We observed that environmental change can alter trade-off shape, and that different physiological mechanisms can lead to different trade-off shapes and different sensitivities to environmental change. These results highlight the important interaction between environment and trade-off shape in affecting ecological and evolutionary dynamics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The consumption of poultry meat and eggs is expected to increase considerably in the nearest future, which creates the demand for new poultry feed ingredients in order to support sustainable intensive production. Moreover, the constant improvement of the genetic potential of poultry has resulted in an increased nutrient density in poultry feeds, which limits the possibility to include low quality feed ingredients. Therefore, the feed industry needs new sources of highly digestible protein with a desirable amino acid composition to substitute other valuable but limited protein sources of animal origin, such as fishmeal. With estimated 1.5 to 3 million species, the class of insects harbours the largest species variety in the world including species providing a high protein and sulphur amino acids content, which can be successfully exploited as feed for poultry. The aim of this paper is to review the present state of knowledge concerning the use of insect protein in poultry nutrition and the possibilities of mass production of insects for the feed industry. There is no doubt that insects have an enormous potential as a source of nutrients (protein) and active substances (polyunsaturated fatty acids, antimicrobial peptides) for poultry. It can be concluded, based on many experimental results, that meals from insects being members of the orders Diptera (black soldier fly, housefly), Coleoptera (mealworms) and Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locust, crickets and katylids), may be successfully used as feed material in poultry diets. However, legislation barriers in the European Union, as well as relatively high costs and limited quantity of produced insects are restrictions in the large-scale use of insect meals in poultry nutrition.},

However its variations according to environment remain not completely understood. We hypothesise that LMA variations of winter oilseed rape (WOSR) follow an ontogenetic trajectory that can be modified by the environment. This was assessed at plant and leaf levels comparing four genotypes field-grown under different environmental conditions characterised by year and nitrogen nutrition. Leaves of the main stem of plants sampled between emergence and harvest were surfaced, oven-dried and weighed to calculate LMA of each individual leaf. At the plant level, LMA presented a common ontogenetic trajectory, which increases from seedling emergence to bolting and from then on decreases. Variations in LMA were related to the variations in plant demand, LMA decreased when demand increased. The trajectory was modified by low N nutrition that increased LMA but differently according to year and genotype, reflecting the plant plasticity. At the leaf level, variations for each individual leaf were related to the variations at the plant level. Plant plasticity and genotypic variability of the responses of LMA to N deficiency seemed to be related to differences in biomass allocation between leaves and stems.},

  abstract = {Quantitative description of food webs provides fundamental information for the understanding of population, community, and ecosystem dynamics. Recently, stable isotope mixing models have been widely used to quantify dietary proportions of different food resources to a focal consumer. Here we propose a novel mixing model (IsoWeb) that estimates diet proportions of all consumers in a food web based on stable isotope information. IsoWeb requires a topological description of a food web, and stable isotope signatures of all consumers and resources in the web. A merit of IsoWeb is that it takes into account variation in trophic enrichment factors among different consumer-resource links. Sensitivity analysis using realistic hypothetical food webs suggests that IsoWeb is applicable to a wide variety of food webs differing in the number of species, connectance, sample size, and data variability. Sensitivity analysis based on real topological webs showed that IsoWeb can allow for a certain level of topological uncertainty in target food webs, including erroneously assuming false links, omission of existent links and species, and trophic aggregation into trophospecies. Moreover, using an illustrative application to a real food web, we demonstrated that IsoWeb can compare the plausibility of different candidate topologies for a focal web. These results suggest that IsoWeb provides a powerful tool to analyze food-web structure from stable isotope data. We provide R and BUGS codes to aid efficient applications of IsoWeb.},

  abstract = {Organisms of all species must balance their allocation to growth, survival and recruitment. Among tree species, evolution has resulted in different life-history strategies for partitioning resources to these key demographic processes. Life-history strategies in tropical forests have often been shown to align along a trade-off between fast growth and high survival, that is, the well-known fast\textendash slow continuum. In addition, an orthogonal trade-off has been proposed between tall stature\textemdash resulting from fast growth and high survival\textemdash and recruitment success, that is, a stature-recruitment trade-off. However, it is not clear whether these two independent dimensions of life-history variation structure tropical forests worldwide. We used data from 13 large-scale and long-term tropical forest monitoring plots in three continents to explore the principal trade-offs in annual growth, survival and recruitment as well as tree stature. These forests included relatively undisturbed forests as well as typhoon-disturbed forests. Life-history variation in 12 forests was structured by two orthogonal trade-offs, the growth-survival trade-off and the stature-recruitment trade-off. Pairwise Procrustes analysis revealed a high similarity of demographic relationships among forests. The small deviations were related to differences between African and Asian plots. Synthesis. The fast\textendash slow continuum and tree stature are two independent dimensions structuring many, but not all tropical tree communities. Our discovery of the consistency of demographic trade-offs and life-history strategies across different forest types from three continents substantially improves our ability to predict tropical forest dynamics worldwide.},

  abstract = {Premise Ecologists have an incomplete understanding of the factors that select for deciduous, evergreen, and marcescent leaf habits. Evergreens have more opportunities for photosynthesis but may experience costs when abiotic conditions are unfavorable such as during ice and windstorms. Methods We documented branch loss for species of oaks (Quercus spp.) in a common garden in California during an unusual windstorm. Results Branches of marcescent trees were more likely to break during the storm, and this pattern had a negligible phylogenetic signature. Branches of evergreen and marcescent species were mostly alive before breaking, which likely accrued a fitness cost, while those of deciduous species were mostly already dead. One explanation for the overrepresentation of broken branches from marcescent species is that their petioles are inflexible and have greater wind loading compared to the flexible petioles of evergreen leaves and the leafless condition of deciduous branches. Conclusions These results suggest that branch loss during unusual winter storms may be an important cost of a marcescent leaf habit.},

There is, however, no consensus regarding the choice of analytical methods. We contrast species- and community-level analyses of change in the functional composition for four traits related to drought tolerance using three decades of repeat censuses of trees in the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Community trait distributions shifted significantly through time, which may indicate a shift toward more drought tolerant species. However, at the species level, changes in abundance were unrelated to trait values. To reconcile these seemingly contrasting results, we evaluated species-specific contributions to the directional shifts observed at the community level. Abundance changes of just one to six of 312 species were responsible for the community-level shifts observed for each trait. Our results demonstrate that directional changes in community-level functional composition can result from idiosyncratic change in a few species rather than widespread community-wide changes associated with functional traits. Future analyses of directional change in natural communities should combine community-, species-, and possibly individual-level analyses to uncover relationships with function that can improve understanding and enable prediction.},

Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits\textemdash almost complete coverage for `plant growth form'. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait\textendash environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.},

Assuming foraging performance to be the central link between metabolic rate and pace of life, we modeled the behavior of biological units with different metabolic rate, as foraging groups with or without within-group variation in metabolic rate, in environments of various resource configurations, with or without group-level behaviors such as information sharing and division of labor. Our results show how metabolic rate can interact with the resource environment to produce differences in energy gain and lifespan. The results also suggest that in a group context, rather than the average metabolic rate of the group, it is the composition of the group that matters such that metabolically diverse groups outperform metabolically homogenous groups. With a proposed experimental approach to test these predictions, these findings bring new insights to possible gene environment interactions that may be involved in the evolution of intraspecific differences in metabolic rates and how metabolic diversity may contribute to the evolution of group living.},

We examined relationships between current-year shoot properties and local light environment in a 14-m tall beech tree growing in a deciduous forest. Leaf number (LN), total leaf area (TLA), and total leaf length (SL) of the current-year shoot increased with increasing photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Leaf thickness, dry mass per leaf area and nitrogen content on a leaf area basis increased, whereas the chlorophyll/N ratio decreased with increasing PPFD. To separate the effects of current-year PPFD from those of previous year(s), we artificially shaded a part of the uppermost leaf tier. Reciprocal transfers of beech seedlings between controlled PPFD regimes were also made. Characteristics of shoot gross morphology such as LN, TLA and SL were largely determined by the PPFD of the previous year. The exception was the length of the longest ``long shoots'' with many leaves, in which elongation appeared to be influenced by both previous-year and current-year PPFD. In contrast, leaf properties were determined by current-year PPFD. The ecological implications of our findings are discussed.},

  abstract = {Urban greenspace has gained considerable attention during the last decades because of its relevance to wildlife conservation, human welfare, and climate change adaptation. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation worldwide require the formation of new concepts of ecological restoration and rehabilitation aimed at improving ecosystem functions, services, and biodiversity conservation in cities. Although relict sites of natural and semi-natural ecosystems can be found in urban areas, environmental conditions and species composition of most urban ecosystems are highly modified, inducing the development of novel and hybrid ecosystems. A consequence of this ecological novelty is the lack of (semi-) natural reference systems available for defining restoration targets and assessing restoration success in urban areas. This hampers the implementation of ecological restoration in cities. In consideration of these challenges, we present a new conceptual framework that provides guidance and support for urban ecological restoration and rehabilitation by formulating restoration targets for different levels of ecological novelty (i. e., historic, hybrid, and novel ecosystems). To facilitate the restoration and rehabilitation of novel urban ecosystems, we recommend using established species-rich and well-functioning urban ecosystems as reference. Such urban reference systems are likely to be present in many cities. Highlighting their value in comparison to degraded ecosystems can stimulate and guide restoration initiatives. As urban restoration approaches must consider local history and site conditions, as well as citizens' needs, it may also be advisable to focus the restoration of strongly altered urban ecosystems on selected ecosystem functions, services and/or biodiversity values. Ecosystem restoration and rehabilitation in cities can be either relatively inexpensive or costly, but even expensive measures can pay off when they effectively improve ecosystem services such as climate change mitigation or recreation. Successful re\`Ashaping and re-thinking of urban greenspace by involving citizens and other stakeholders will help to make our cities more sustainable in the future.},

  abstract = {1 Using a sample of 24 common deciduous angiosperm trees of the Eastern Deciduous Forest region of North America, we tested the hypothesis that leaf size variation across species can be interpreted in terms of a trade-off between individual leaf mass and the number of leaves produced. 2 The true nature of a resource allocation trade-off is detectable only if variation in the total amount of growth is accounted for. We controlled for this effect by measuring all of the components of annual growth associated with leaf production at the individual terminal shoot level. Hence, number of leaves produced was expressed as `leafing intensity', i.e. the number of leaves produced by newly emerged (current year's) shoots, divided by the total volume of these shoots. 3 Ninety per cent (r2 = 0.90) of the variation in mean individual leaf mass across species, spanning two orders of magnitude, could be accounted for by proportional variation in mean leafing intensity, i.e. representing an isometric trade-off, with a slope for log-transformed data that did not deviate significantly from -1.0. 4 We suggest that this isometric relationship may represent a generalized trade-off strategy for leaf deployment at the shoot level within temperate deciduous woody species. Following traditional interpretations, adaptation here may involve a fitness benefit associated with a particular leaf size. The present results also suggest an alternative, i.e. selection may instead favour high leafing intensity, with small leaf mass resulting not as a direct adaptation, but simply as a trade-off. 5 According to this `leafing intensity premium' hypothesis, the fitness benefits of higher leafing intensity are associated primarily with the fitness benefits of a larger pool of lateral meristems, because each leaf is usually associated with an axillary bud. This may in turn provide greater facility for wide phenotypic plasticity in the allocation of these meristems to vegetative vs. reproductive functions. This represents a plausible hypothesis, we suggest, in accounting for why most woody deciduous angiosperms, even some of the largest/tallest ones, have relatively small leaves.},

  abstract = {Trade-offs in species performances of different ecological functions is one of the most common explanations for coexistence in communities. Despite the potential for species coexistence occurring at local or regional spatial scales, trade-offs are typically approached at a single scale. In recent years, ecologists have increasingly provided evidence for the importance of community processes at both local and regional spatial scales. This review summarizes the theoretical predictions for the traits associated with trade-offs under different conditions and at different spatial scales. We provide a spatial framework for understanding trade-offs, coexistence and the supportive empirical evidence. Predictions are presented that link the patterns of diversity observed to the patterns of trade-offs that lead to coexistence at different spatial scales. Recent evidence for the evolution of trade-offs under different conditions is provided which explores both laboratory microcosm studies and phylogenetic tests. Examining trade-offs within a spatial framework can provide a strong approach to understanding community structure and dynamics, while explaining patterns of species diversity.},

  abstract = {Niche Theory is a central framework in ecology based on the recognition that most interactions between organisms are indirect, mediated by the biotic and abiotic dynamical environment these organisms live in. Despite its potential generality, the theory still mostly focuses on how resource\textendash consumer dynamics mediate competition in ecological communities. However, it is being increasingly recognized that positive interactions between organisms also play an important role in driving the structure and functioning of ecological communities, from plants to microbes. In this paper, we present a unified theory of the niche that applies to both positive and negative interactions between organisms, mediated by one or two environmental factors. We show that classical concepts such as niche differences and fundamental and realized niches can naturally be expanded to facilitative and mutualistic interactions. In addition, we introduce and formalize new general niche concepts that appear exclusively in the presence of positive interactions: (1) the Allee niche, a region of environmental conditions for which a species can persist but not invade from low densities and (2) niche facilitation, when the presence of a species expands the set of environmental conditions under which a second species can invade and/or persist. To show the broad applicability of this theory, we illustrate these concepts using a diverse set of theoretical examples, from bacteria feeding on an inhibiting substrate, to nitrogen-fixing plants and the indirect mutualism between a plant and a carnivore species. In sum, our work shows how Niche Theory provides a natural framework for positive interactions in ecology, bringing a unified perspective and new conceptual tools to study ecological systems where these positive interactions occur.},

In mitigating pandemic influenza, effective allocation of limited health resources also plays a critical role along with effective use of medical prevention and treatment procedures. A national resource allocation program for prevention and treatment must be supported with the right allocation decisions for all regions and population risk groups. In this study, we develop a multi-objective mathematical programming model for optimal resource allocation decisions in a country where a serious risk of pandemic influenza may exist. These resources include monetary budget for antivirals and preventive vaccinations, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and nonIntensive Care Unit (non-ICU) beds. The mathematical model has three objectives: minimization of number of deaths, number of cases and total morbidity days during a pandemic influenza. This model can be used as a decision support tool by decision makers to assess the impact of different scenarios such as attack rates, hospitalization and death ratios. These factors are found to be very influential on the allocation of the total budget among preventive vaccination, antiviral treatment and fixed resources. The data set collected from various sources for Turkey is used and analyzed in detail as a case study.},

  abstract = {While scavenging has been repeatedly reported for several felid species, surprisingly little information is available on scavenging behavior of the European wildcat (Felis silvestris). To fill this knowledge gap, we used camera traps to document scavenging behavior at the 48 experimentally set deer carcasses at random locations throughout the year. We recorded European wildcats scavenging on 38\% of the eight carcasses set in winter and on none set in the other parts of the year. Wildcats fed on two carcasses for extended periods (up to 22 days) with an average of 3.3 visits per day and 7.8-h interval between the visits. We recorded scavenging throughout the day, but analysis indicated a crepuscular pattern. We also recorded caching behavior on 7\% of the visits (n = 105), when wildcats used leaves or snow to partly or completely cover the carcasses. Beside wildcats, 12 other vertebrate species of scavengers were recorded at the carcasses. We recorded agonistic interaction with European badger (Meles meles) and despite its smaller size, the wildcat managed to defend the carcass. The extensive feeding, frequent caching behavior and active defense from scavengers indicate that the wildcats recognized the ungulate carcasses as an important food source in winter and that scavenging could be a neglected aspect of the European wildcat ecology. We also suggest that caching behavior could be regularly used by the European wildcat when feeding on larger carcasses, but was likely previously missed due to limited research effort to record scavenging and caching behavior.},

  abstract = {Premise Invasive species tend to possess acquisitive plant traits that support fast growth and strong competitive ability. However, the relevance of symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to the fast growing, acquisitive strategy of invasive species is still unclear. Methods We measured AMF colonization in roots of five congeneric pairs of invasive and native eastern North American woody species (10 species total; 4 lianas, 6 shrubs) that were grown in a monoculture common garden experiment in Syracuse, NY. We then examined the relationships of AMF colonization to above and belowground traits of these species. Results Total AMF colonization and arbuscule colonization were greater in invasive compared to native woody species, a pattern that was more distinct in congeneric shrubs than congeneric lianas. The level of AMF colonization was also positively correlated with traits indicative of rapid plant growth and nutrient uptake. Conclusions The concordance of a resource-acquisitive strategy with higher AMF colonization suggests that symbioses with AMF may be part of the strategy by which invasive woody plants of eastern North America are able to maintain fast growth rates and outcompete their native counterparts.},

  abstract = {Premise The phenomenon called ``diminishing returns'' refers to a scaling relationship between lamina mass (M) vs. lamina area (A) in many species, i.e., M {$\propto$} A{$\alpha>$}1, where {$\alpha$} is the scaling exponent exceeding unity. Prior studies have focused on the scaling relationships between lamina dry mass (DM) and A, or between fresh mass (FM) and A. However, the scaling between petiole mass and M and A has seldom been investigated. Here, we examine the scaling relationships among FM, DM, A, and petiole fresh mass (PFM). Methods For each of 3268 leaves from nine Lauraceae species, FM, DM, A, and PFM were measured, and their scaling relationships were fitted using reduced major axis regression protocols. The bootstrap percentile method was used to test the significance of the difference in {$\alpha$}-values between any two species. Results The phenomenon of diminishing returns was verified between FM vs. A and DM vs. A. The FM vs. A scaling relationship was statistically more robust than the DM vs. A scaling relationship based on bivariate regression r2-values. Diminishing returns were also observed for the PFM vs. FM and PFM vs. A scaling relationships. The PFM vs. FM scaling relationship was statistically more robust than the PFM vs. A scaling relationship. Conclusions ``Diminishing returns'' was confirmed among the FM, DM, A, and PFM scaling relationships. The data collectively indicate that the petiole scales mechanically more strongly with lamina mass than with area, suggesting that static (self) loading takes precedence over dynamic (wind) loading.},

  abstract = {Natural photic regime has been drastically altered by the artificial night sky luminance. Despite evidence of sufficient light brightness inducing plant physiology and affecting phenology, generalization regarding effects of light pollution on plant phenology across species and locations is less clear. Meanwhile, the relative contributions and joint effects of artificial light pollution and climate change or other anthropic stressors still remain unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized in situ plant phenological observations of seven tree species during 1991\textendash 2015 in Europe, night-time light dataset and gridded temperature dataset to investigate the impacts of the artificial light pollution on spatial-temporal shifts of plant phenological phases under climatic warming. We found 70\% of the observation sites were exposed to increased light pollution during 1992\textendash 2015. Among them, plant phenological phases substantially delayed at 12\textendash 39\% observation sites of leaf-out, and 6\textendash 53\% of flowering. We also found plant species appeared to be more sensitive to artificial light pollution, and phenology advancement was hindered more prominently and even delay phenomenon exhibited when the color level showed stronger sky brightness. Linear mixed models indicate that although temperature plays a dominant role in shifts of plant phenological phases at the spatial scale, the inhibitory effect of artificial light pollution is evident considering the interactions. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantitatively establish the relationship between artificial light pollution and plant phenology across species and locations. Meanwhile, these findings provide a new insight into the ecological responses of plant phenology to the potential but poorly understood environmental stressors under this warmer world and call for light pollution to be accorded the equal status as other global change phenomena.},

The model describes both feeding and non-feeding stages, and hence is applicable to embryos (which neither feed nor reproduce), juveniles (which feed but do not reproduce), and adults (which commonly both feed and reproduce). Embryonic growth can have two forms depending on the assumptions for acquisition of energy from yolk. By default, when the energy acquisition rate exceeds the maintenance rate, a fixed proportion of the resulting net production is spent on growth (increase in structural biomass), and the remaining portion is channelled to the reserves.

Under constant environmental conditions, the growth of a juvenile is always of von Bertalanffy type.

  abstract = {The standard Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model assumes that assimilates of an isomorphic individual are first added to reserve, a fraction {$\kappa$} of mobilised reserve is allocated to soma (somatic maintenance plus growth of structure), and the rest to maturity maintenance and maturation or reproduction. Food, reserve and structure have constant chemical composition. We here discuss all possible topological alternatives to the standard DEB model, and compare them on the basis of seven properties: the ability to capture weak homeostasis and general empirical growth and reproduction patterns. We selected a reserve dynamics such that reserve mobilisation rate is independent of assimilation, somatic maintenance is proportional to the amount of structure, maturity maintenance to the level of maturity, and assimilation to the surface area. The alternatives only differ from the standard DEB model in topology, but we drop the {$\kappa$}-rule and allow {$\kappa$} to vary with the amount of structure. For this purpose we introduce the concept `generalised von Bertalanffy growth rate' and study how it behaves as a function of the ultimate structural length, both intra- and inter-specifically. The 21 derived topological alternatives of the standard DEB are classified into five classes of models, depending on the first allocation event for the assimilation flux. The possibilities of the first allocation event for the assimilation flux are: splitting ({$\kappa$}-models), storing (A-models), both maintenance fluxes simultaneously (P-models), somatic maintenance (S-models) or maturity maintenance (J-models). We conclude that the standard DEB model with constant {$\kappa$} is the only one that passes all our tests successfully. Only assimilation (A) models can naturally accommodate embryo development. The {$\kappa$}-models, which after splitting the fraction 1-{$\kappa$} of assimilates is allocated to maturity maintenance and maturity/reproduction while the fraction {$\kappa$} of assimilates is first stored in reserve or allocated to somatic maintenance, pass most tests, but have maturation and reproduction directly from food. So, embryos have to do this differently and reproduction is prohibited during starvation in these models.},

  abstract = {Many animals must often respond to environmental patterns that simulatneously influence both foraging efficiency and predation risk. We noted that grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) sometimes immediately consume food items in areas of relatively great exposure to predators, and at other times carry food items to the safety of a tree prior to consumption. We outlined a hypothesis that the squirrels were somehow trading-off energy intake rate against predation risk. A simple model shows that maximal energetic efficiency is associated with immediate consumption, whereas (under the field conditions studied) carrying items to the safety of trees provides for minimal exposure to predation. Our analysis of the model predicts that the tendency to carry a food item should decrease with distance of food from cover (travel time) and increase with item size (handling time). To test our predictions, we presented free-roaming grey squirrels with patches containing a fixed number of identical food items. We estimated the proportion of items carried to trees before consumption for 12 different combinations of distance to the nearest tree and item size. The results support our hypothesis and indicate that a simple behavioural criterion based solely on foraging rate or time exposed to predators is insufficient to explain the variation in the data.},

The competition-defence hypothesis posits a trade-off between competitive ability and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The growth-defence hypothesis suggests that strong competitors for nutrients are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500 species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance in species responses to both treatments provided support for a growth-defence trade-off: populations that increased with the removal of nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal of consumers. This result held globally across 4 years within plant life-history groups and within the majority of individual sites. Thus, a growth-defence trade-off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms maintaining grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.},

  abstract = {Trait-based approaches to community structure are increasingly used in terrestrial ecology. We show that such an approach, augmented by a mechanistic analysis of trade-offs among functional traits, can be successfully used to explain community composition of marine phytoplankton along environmental gradients. Our analysis of literature on major functional traits in phytoplankton, such as parameters of nutrient-dependent growth and uptake, reveals physiological trade-offs in species abilities to acquire and utilize resources. These trade-offs, arising from fundamental relations such as cellular scaling laws and enzyme kinetics, define contrasting ecological strategies of nutrient acquisition. Major groups of marine eukaryotic phytoplankton have adopted distinct strategies with associated traits. These diverse strategies of nutrient utilization can explain the distribution patterns of major functional groups and size classes along nutrient availability gradients.},

Although numerous studies have tested its potential biological and ecological impacts on animals, very few studies have tested whether it affects alien and native plants differently. Furthermore, common plant species, and particularly common alien species, are often found to benefit more from additional resources than rare native and rare alien species. Whether this is also the case with regard to increasing light due to ALAN is still unknown. Here, we tested how ALAN affected the performance of common and rare alien and native plant species in Germany directly, and indirectly via flying insects. We grew five common alien, six rare alien, five common native, and four rare native plant species under four combinations of two ALAN (no ALAN vs. ALAN) and two insect-exclusion (no exclusion vs. exclusion) treatments, and compared their biomass production. We found that common plant species, irrespective of their origin, produced significantly more biomass than rare species and that this was particularly true under ALAN. Furthermore, alien species tended to show a slightly stronger positive response to ALAN than native species did (p = .079). Our study shows that common plant species benefited more from ALAN than rare ones. This might lead to competitive exclusion of rare species, which could have cascading impacts on other trophic levels and thus have important community-wide consequences when ALAN becomes more widespread. In addition, the slightly more positive response of alien species indicates that ALAN might increase the risk of alien plant invasions.},

It is proposed that tree life-history traits are adaptations to particular disturbance regimes. Four independent axes are proposed to define the dominant dimensions of tree strategy space: shade tolerance, tree height, capacity for vegetative reproduction, and seed dispersal distance. A fitness model was developed to elucidate interactions between the proposed life-history traits. The model shows how alternate life-history sets can coexist when disturbance patterns fluctuate in space and time. Variable disturbance regimes were shown, based on data and simulation results, to enhance species coexistence, as predicted. The strategy space model accurately predicts the number of common tree species for the eastern United States, boreal Canada, and southwestern pi\~non-juniper woodlands. The model also provides an explanation for latitudinal gradients in tree species richness in North America and Europe. The proposed model predicts a relationship between disturbance characteristics and the species composition of a forest that allows for the coexistence of large numbers of species. The life-history traits of size, growth rate, life span, shade tolerance, age of reproduction, seed dispersal distance, and vegetative reproduction are all incorporated into the model.},

However, PAs are criticized for their limited ecological effectiveness and their negative social impacts. This article seeks to provide an overview on the contested nature of PAs and places PAs in the tension field of conservation and development, which are diverging forces specifically in the Global South. A reconciliation of PAs as parts of a wider landscape of interlinked social-ecological systems may increase the potential of PAs to contribute to the sustainable development goals, including the creation of sustainable human-nature relationships, environmental health and landscape resilience. The environmental justice framework appears useful in the endeavour to improve the social-ecological integrity of current conservation practises and to increase the ability of PA systems to withstand shocks. Considering PAs as systems in which people and nature interact in manifold ways may help increase their integrity, but understanding these interactions requires sustainability researchers and conservation practitioners to recognize the plurality in value towards nature, nature understanding and conceptualisations. Such deep understanding seems pivotal in working towards synergies of sustainable use, biocultural diversity and wilderness. Concludingly, this article emphasizes the need for holistic approaches rather than sectoral specialisations and radicalisations to achieve arrays of sustainability goals.},

However, no current U.S. estimates are based on systematic analysis of multiple data sources. We reviewed the published literature and acquired unpublished datasets to systematically quantify bird\textendash building collision mortality and species-specific vulnerability. Based on 23 studies, we estimate that between 365 and 988 million birds (median {$\frac{1}{4}$} 599 million) are killed annually by building collisions in the U.S., with roughly 56\% of mortality at low-rises, 44\% at residences, and ,1\% at high-rises. Based on .92,000 fatality records, and after controlling for population abundance and range overlap with study sites, we identified several species that are disproportionately vulnerable to collisions at all building types. In addition, several species listed as national Birds of Conservation Concern due to their declining populations were identified to be highly vulnerable to building collisions, including Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera), Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris), Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Kentucky Warbler (Geothlypis formosa), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum). The identification of these five migratory species with geographic ranges limited to eastern and central North America reflects seasonal and regional biases in the currently available building-collision data. Most sampling has occurred during migration and in the eastern U.S. Further research across seasons and in underrepresented regions is needed to reduce this bias. Nonetheless, we provide quantitative evidence to support the conclusion that building collisions are second only to feral and free-ranging pet cats, which are estimated to kill roughly four times as many birds each year, as the largest source of direct human-caused mortality for U.S. birds.},

The `whole-plant compensation point', interpolated from stem growth measurements across a wide range of light environments, has been proposed as a simple, robust measure of species shade tolerance. Others have argued that shade tolerance is primarily a function of differential ability to survive periods of slow growth (`suppression'), implying that measurements of survival are vital. We measured growth of juveniles (500\textendash 1000 mm tall) of five evergreen trees over 12 months in a cool-temperate rain forest in New Zealand, to determine whether whole-plant compensation points predicted species differences in occupancy of understorey light environments, which were quantified using hemispherical photography. The five species encompassed 3{$\cdot$}5-fold variation in whole-plant compensation points. Compensation points of most species fell within the first quartile of the distribution of light environments occupied by juveniles; they were also correlated with low-light mortality rates of juveniles, estimated from permanent plot data archived in the National Vegetation Survey Databank. Compensation points were also significantly positively correlated with height growth rates in high light, confirming the presence of the growth vs. shade tolerance trade-off detected in many other forest tree assemblages. Results show that, in temperate evergreen forests, the whole-plant compensation point distinguishes reliably between species of differing shade tolerance. Excepting situations involving parameterization of demographic models, shade tolerance can therefore be assessed without survival measurements. However, estimating whole-plant compensation points may prove more difficult in deciduous forests, where seasonal variation in understorey light transmission poses additional challenges.},

  abstract = {Soundscape studies are increasingly used to capture landscape-scale ecological patterns. Yet, several aspects of soundscape diversity remain unexplored. Although some processes influencing acoustic niche usage may operate in the 24-hr temporal domain, most acoustic indices only capture the diversity of sounds co-occurring in sound files at a specific time of day. Moreover, many indices do not consider the relationship between the spectral and temporal traits of sounds simultaneously. To provide novel insights into landscape-scale patterns of acoustic niche usage at broader temporal scales, we present a workflow to quantify soundscape diversity through the lens of trait-based ecology. Our workflow quantifies the diversity of sound in the 24-hr acoustic trait space. We introduce the Operational Sound Unit (OSU), a unit of diversity measurement that groups sounds by their shared acoustic properties. Using OSUs and building on the framework of Hill numbers, we propose three metrics that capture different aspects of acoustic trait space usage: (i) soundscape richness, (ii) soundscape diversity and (iii) soundscape evenness. We demonstrate the use of these metrics by (a) simulating soundscapes to assess whether the indices possess a set of desirable behaviours and (b) quantifying soundscape richness and evenness along a gradient in species richness. We demonstrate that (a) the indices outlined herein have desirable behaviours and (b) the soundscape richness and evenness are positively correlated with the richness of sound-producing species. This suggests that more acoustic niche space is occupied when the species richness is higher. Additionally, species-poor acoustic communities have a higher proportion of rare sounds and use the acoustic space less evenly. Our workflow generates novel insights into acoustic niche usage at a landscape scale and provides a useful tool for biodiversity monitoring. Moreover, Hill numbers can also be used to measure the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity. Using a common framework for diversity measurement gives metrics a common behaviour, interpretation and standardised unit, thus ensuring comparisons between soundscape diversity and other metrics represent real-world ecological patterns rather than mathematical artefacts stemming from different formulae.},

We here solve the experimental problems by employing synthetic ecology. We engineer strains of Escherichia coli with fixed resource allocations enabling accurate measurement of trade-off shapes between bacterial survival and multiplication in multiple environments. A mathematical chemostat model predicts different, and experimentally verified, trajectories of gene frequency changes as a function of condition-specific trade-offs.

  abstract = {Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a widespread alteration of the natural environment that can affect the functioning of ecosystems. ALAN can change the movement patterns of freshwater animals that move into the adjacent riparian and terrestrial ecosystems, but the implications for local riparian consumers that rely on these subsidies are still unexplored. We conducted a 2-year field experiment to quantify changes of freshwater-terrestrial linkages by installing streetlights in a previously light-na\"ive riparian area adjacent to an agricultural drainage ditch. We compared the abundance and community composition of emerging aquatic insects, flying insects, and ground-dwelling arthropods with an unlit control site. Comparisons were made within and between years using two-way generalized least squares (GLS) model and a BACI design (Before-After Control-Impact). Aquatic insect emergence, the proportion of flying insects that were aquatic in origin, and the total abundance of flying insects all increased in the ALAN-illuminated area. The abundance of several night-active ground-dwelling predators (Pachygnatha clercki, Trochosa sp., Opiliones) increased under ALAN and their activity was extended into the day. Conversely, the abundance of nocturnal ground beetles (Carabidae) decreased under ALAN. The changes in composition of riparian predator and scavenger communities suggest that the increase in aquatic-to-terrestrial subsidy flux may cascade through the riparian food web. The work is among the first studies to experimentally manipulate ALAN using a large-scale field experiment, and provides evidence that ALAN can affect processes that link adjacent ecosystems. Given the large number of streetlights that are installed along shorelines of freshwater bodies throughout the globe, the effects could be widespread and represent an underestimated source of impairment for both aquatic and riparian systems.},

  abstract = {Despite theoretical advances, the ecological factors and functional traits that enable species varying in seed size and fecundity to coexist remain unclear. Given inherent fecundity advantages, why don't small-seeded species dominate communities? In perennial grasslands, we evaluated whether small-seeded species are less tolerant of competition from the community dominant bunchgrass than large-seeded species, but also less vulnerable to seed predation by mice. We also explored whether trade-offs involving competitive tolerance include two other functional traits, height and leaf mass per area (LMA). We added seeds of 17 forb species to plots where bunchgrass competition and rodent seed predation were manipulated across sites varying in bunchgrass productivity and thus competitive intensity. Seeds were added at densities mimicking interspecific variation in fecundity among target species. Standardizing for differences in fecundity (i.e. seed input, which enabled us to evaluate inherent interspecific differences in susceptibility to biotic interactions), bunchgrass competition more greatly reduced recruitment and establishment of small- versus large-seeded species, whereas rodent seed predation more greatly reduced the recruitment of large- versus small-seeded species. Plant height and LMA were unrelated to the competition effect size. Small-seeded species abundance decreased across sites increasing in bunchgrass productivity, whereas this was not the case for large-seeded species. For adult plants but not seedlings, community-weighted functional trait means (CWM) for seed size, height and LMA increased in plots with versus without bunchgrass competition and the CWM for seed size and height also increased at sites with greater bunchgrass productivity (for adults only). In contrast, rodent seed predation had no significant effects on CWM seed size. At the end of the experiment, adult abundance positively correlated with plant fecundity in plots lacking bunchgrass, indicating the inherent advantages accrued to high fecundity small-seeded species. However, with bunchgrass competition, abundances were equalized across species due to reduced competitive tolerance of high fecundity small-seeded species. Synthesis. Our results suggest that coexistence among subordinate forb species varying in seed size and fecundity is in-part due to a trade-off involving competitive tolerance and fecundity, mediated by seed size and associated functional traits.},

We hypothesised that competitive interactions with a close relative, Poecilia picta, in brackish water prevents P. reticulata from colonising brackish water. Using a combination of field transplant, common garden breeding, and laboratory behaviour experiments, we find support for this hypothesis, as P. reticulata are behaviourally subordinate and have lower survival in brackish water with P. picta. We also found a negative genetic correlation between P. reticulata growth in brackish water versus freshwater in the presence of P. picta, suggesting a genetically based trade-off between salinity tolerance and competitive ability could constrain adaptive evolution at the range limit.},

Despite a wealth of studies exploring trait relationships across the entire plant kingdom, the dominant traits underpinning these unique aspects of tree form and function remain unclear. Here, by considering 18 functional traits, encompassing leaf, seed, bark, wood, crown, and root characteristics, we quantify the multidimensional relationships in tree trait expression. We find that nearly half of trait variation is captured by two axes: one reflecting leaf economics, the other reflecting tree size and competition for light. Yet these orthogonal axes reveal strong environmental convergence, exhibiting correlated responses to temperature, moisture, and elevation. By subsequently exploring multidimensional trait relationships, we show that the full dimensionality of trait space is captured by eight distinct clusters, each reflecting a unique aspect of tree form and function. Collectively, this work identifies a core set of traits needed to quantify global patterns in functional biodiversity, and it contributes to our fundamental understanding of the functioning of forests worldwide.},

  abstract = {Severe droughts have been associated with regional-scale forest mortality worldwide. Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions.

However, plant strategies may also represent density- or frequency-dependent adaptations to the strategies used by neighbours. Game theory provides the tools to characterise such density- and frequency-dependent interactions. Here, we review the contributions of game theory to plant ecology. After briefly reviewing game theory from the perspective of plant ecology, we divide our review into three sections. First, game theoretical models of allocation to shoots and roots often predict investment in those organs beyond what would be optimal in the absence of competition. Second, game theoretical models of enemy defence suggest that an individual's investment in defence is not only a means of reducing its own tissue damage but also a means of deflecting enemies onto competitors. Finally, game theoretical models of trade with mutualistic partners suggest that the optimal trade may reflect competition for access to mutualistic partners among plants. In short, our review provides an accessible entrance to game theory that will help plant ecologists enrich their research with its worldview and existing predictions.},

It is thought that the sugar-conducting sieve tube may overwinter and that its cells persist multiple seasons in deciduous trees. One possible overwintering strategy is to build up callose on phloem sieve plates to temporarily cease their function. We tested the hypothesis that five deciduous tree species produce callose on their sieve plates on a seasonal basis. Methods Young shoots of five deciduous tree species were sampled periodically between April 2019 and February 2020 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. After enzymatic digestion of cytoplasmic constituents, cross sections were imaged using scanning electron microscopy to observe and quantify the level of callose deposition at monthly intervals, and sieve plate pore size was measured. Using a conductivity apparatus, we measured xylem native embolism during these sampling periods. Results Contrary to past work on some of the same species, we found little evidence that sieve tubes overwinter by becoming occluded with callose. Instead, we found that most sieve plates remain open. Xylem embolism was minimal during the peak growing season, but increased over winter. Conclusions Many species had been assumed to deposit callose on sieve plates over winter, though anatomical and phenological phloem data were sparse. Our data do not support this notion.},

Lights may interfere with anti-bat defensive behaviours in moths, and disrupt a complex and globally ubiquitous interaction between bats and insects, ultimately leading to detrimental consequences for ecosystems on a global scale. We combined experimental and mathematical approaches to determine effects of light pollution on a free-living bat\textendash insect community. We compared prey selection by Cape serotine bats Neoromicia capensis in naturally unlit and artificially lit conditions using a manipulative field experiment, and developed a probabilistic model based on a suite of prey-selection factors to explain differences in observed diet. Moth consumption by N. capensis was low under unlit conditions (mean percentage volume {$\pm$} SD: 5{$\cdot$}91 {$\pm$} 6{$\cdot$}25\%), while moth consumption increased sixfold (mean percentage volume {$\pm$} SD: 35{$\cdot$}42 {$\pm$} 17{$\cdot$}90\%) under lit conditions despite a decrease in relative moth abundance. Predictive prey-selection models that included high-efficacy estimates for eared-moth defensive behaviour found most support given diet data for bats in unlit conditions. Conversely, models that estimated eared-moth defensive behaviour as absent or low found more support given diet data for bats in lit conditions. Our models therefore suggest the increase in moth consumption was a result of light-induced, decreased eared-moth defensive behaviour. Policy implications. In the current context of unyielding growth in global light pollution, we predict that specialist moth-eating bats and eared moths will face ever-increasing challenges to survival through increased resource competition and predation risk, respectively. Lights should be developed to be less attractive to moths, with the goal of reducing effects on moth behaviour. Unfortunately, market preference for broad-spectrum lighting and possible effects on other taxa make development of moth-friendly lighting improbable. Mitigation should therefore focus on the reduction of temporal, spatial and luminance redundancy in outdoor lighting. Restriction of light inside nature reserves and urban greenbelts can help maintain dark refugia for moth-eating bats and moths, and may become important for their persistence.},

In order to use ABC in a time-efficient manner users must make several design decisions including how to code the ABC algorithm and the type of ABC algorithm to use. Furthermore, ABC relies on a number of user defined choices which can greatly effect the accuracy of estimation. Having a clear understanding of these factors in reducing computation time and improving accuracy allows users to make more informed decisions when planning analyses. In this paper, we present an introduction to ABC with a focus of application to infectious disease models.

  abstract = {Polar bear (Ursus maritimus) populations are predicted to be negatively affected by climate warming, but the timeframe and manner in which change to polar bear populations will occur remains unclear. Predictions incorporating climate change effects are necessary for proactive population management, the setting of optimal harvest quotas, and conservation status decisions. Such predictions are difficult to obtain from historic data directly because past and predicted environmental conditions differ substantially. Here, we explore how models can be used to predict polar bear population responses under climate change. We suggest the development of mechanistic models aimed at predicting reproduction and survival as a function of the environment. Such models can often be developed, parameterized, and tested under current environmental conditions. Model predictions for reproduction and survival under future conditions could then be input into demographic projection models to improve abundance predictions under climate change. We illustrate the approach using two examples. First, using an individual-based dynamic energy budget model, we estimate that 3\textendash 6\% of adult males in Western Hudson Bay would die of starvation before the end of a 120day summer fasting period but 28\textendash 48\% would die if climate warming increases the fasting period to 180days. Expected changes in survival are non-linear (sigmoid) as a function of fasting period length. Second, we use an encounter rate model to predict changes in female mating probability under sea ice area declines and declines in mate-searching efficiency due to habitat fragmentation. The model predicts that mating success will decline non-linearly if searching efficiency declines faster than habitat area, and increase non-linearly otherwise. Specifically for the Lancaster Sound population, we predict that female mating success would decline from 99\% to 91\% if searching efficiency declined twice as fast as sea ice area, and to 72\% if searching efficiency declined four times as fast as area. Sea ice is a complex and dynamic habitat that is rapidly changing. Failure to incorporate climate change effects into population projections can result in flawed conservation assessments and management decisions.},

Ecologists most often explain G\textendash D tradeoffs through principles of economic optimality, in which negative trait correlations are attributed to the reconciliation of fitness costs. Recently, researchers in molecular biology have developed `big data' resources including multi-omic (e.g. transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) studies that describe the cellular processes controlling gene expression in model species. In this synthesis, we bridge ecological theory with discoveries in multi-omics biology to better understand how selection has shaped the mechanisms of G\textendash D tradeoffs. Multi-omic studies reveal strategically coordinated patterns in resource allocation that are enabled by phytohormone crosstalk and transcriptional signal cascades. Coordinated resource allocation justifies the framework of optimality theory, while providing mechanistic insight into the feedbacks and control hubs that calibrate G\textendash D tradeoff commitments. We use the existing literature to describe the coordinated resource allocation hypothesis (CoRAH) that accounts for balanced cellular controls during the expression of G\textendash D tradeoffs, while sustaining stored resource pools to buffer the impacts of future stresses. The integrative mechanisms of the CoRAH unify the supply- and demand-side perspectives of previous G\textendash D tradeoff theories.},

Achieving this goal requires simplifying this complexity in synthetic axes defining a trait space and to cluster species based on their traits while identifying those with unique combinations of traits. However, so far, we know little about the dimensionality, the robustness to trait omission and the structure of these trait spaces. Here, we propose a unified framework and a synthesis across 30 trait datasets representing a broad variety of taxa, ecosystems and spatial scales to show that a common trade-off between trait space quality and operationality appears between three and six dimensions. The robustness to trait omission is generally low but highly variable among datasets. We also highlight invariant scaling relationships, whatever organismal complexity, between the number of clusters, the number of species in the dominant cluster and the number of unique species with total species richness. When species richness increases, the number of unique species saturates, whereas species tend to disproportionately pack in the richest cluster. Based on these results, we propose some rules of thumb to build species trait spaces and estimate subsequent functional diversity indices.},

Hard leaves with high mass per unit area (LMA) occur more frequently in water- and nutrient-limited habitats, where stress-tolerance is key to survival. Coordination between leaf mechanical properties and drought tolerance can arise because some (but not all) of the anatomical modifications leading to high LMA are mechanistically correlated to physiological traits conferring tolerance to dehydration. Thick cell walls are frequently coupled with low turgor loss point values, and also prevent cell shrinkage and collapse after turgor loss has occurred. This also protects the leaf against shrinking-induced loss of water transport capacity in the extra-vascular pathway. In turn, vascular water transport in the leaf veins is at risk of embolism-induced disruption under drought, but higher length of major veins per unit area can provide alternative pathways for water delivery to the mesophyll, while contributing to increased leaf stiffness. Water shortage in dry and warm habitats implies the risk of reduced photosynthetic rates, apparently favouring species that produce hard and drought-tolerant leaves, to warrant long leaf life span and to maintain gas exchange and positive carbon gain when conditions become harsh.},

However, given the diversity of tree species and forest biomes, quantifying the multitude of demographic strategies within and across forests and the way that they translate into forest structure and function remains a significant challenge. Here, we quantify the demographic rates of 1961 tree species from temperate and tropical forests and evaluate how demographic diversity (DD) and demographic composition (DC) differ across forests, and how these differences in demography relate to species richness, aboveground biomass (AGB), and carbon residence time. We find wide variation in DD and DC across forest plots, patterns that are not explained by species richness or climate variables alone. There is no evidence that DD has an effect on either AGB or carbon residence time. Rather, the DC of forests, specifically the relative abundance of large statured species, predicted both biomass and carbon residence time. Our results demonstrate the distinct DCs of globally distributed forests, reflecting biogeography, recent history, and current plot conditions. Linking the DC of forests to resilience or vulnerability to climate change, will improve the precision and accuracy of predictions of future forest composition, structure, and function.},

This analysis is based on a Kolmogorov-type canopy partitioning model for plant species with clonal growth form and fixed vertical leaf profiles (Vance and Nevai in J. Theor. Biol., 2007, to appear). We show that canopy partitioning is necessary for the stable coexistence of the two competing plant species. We also use implicit methods to show that, under certain conditions, the species' nullclines can intersect at most once. We use nullcline endpoint analysis to show that when the nullclines do intersect, and in such a way that they cross, then the resulting equilibrium point is always stable. We also construct surfaces that divide parameter space into regions within which the various outcomes of competition occur, and then study parameter dependence in the locations of these surfaces. The analysis presented here and in a companion paper (Nevai and Vance, The role of leaf height in plant competition for sunlight: analysis of a canopy partitioning model, in review) together shows that canopy partitioning is both necessary and, under appropriate parameter values, sufficient for the stable coexistence of two hypothetical plant species whose structure and growth are described by our model.},

  abstract = {The present study was undertaken to test for the hypothesis that the rate of development in the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport per unit area (Jmax;A), and maximum carboxylase activity of Rubisco (Vcmax;A) is proportional to average integrated daily quantum flux density (Qint) in a mixed deciduous forest dominated by the shade-intolerant species Populus tremula L., and the shade-tolerant species Tilia cordata Mill. We distinguished between the age-dependent changes in net assimilation rates due to modifications in leaf dry mass per unit area (MA), foliar nitrogen content per unit dry mass (NM), and fractional partitioning of foliar nitrogen in the proteins of photosynthetic electron transport (FB), Rubisco (FR) and in light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complexes (Vcmax;A {$\propto$} MANMFR; Jmax;A {$\propto$} MANMFB). In both species, increases in Jmax;A and Vcmax;A during leaf development were primarily determined by nitrogen allocation to growing leaves, increases in leaf nitrogen partitioning in photosynthetic machinery, and increases in MA. Canopy differences in the rate of development of leaf photosynthetic capacity were mainly controlled by the rate of change in MA. There was only small within-canopy variation in the initial rate of biomass accumulation per unit Qint (slope of MA versus leaf age relationship per unit Qint), suggesting that canopy differences in the rate of development of Jmax;A and Vcmax;A are directly proportional to Qint. Nevertheless, MA, nitrogen, Jmax;A and Vcmax;A of mature leaves were not proportional to Qint because of a finite MA in leaves immediately after bud-burst (light-independent component of MA). MA, leaf chlorophyll contents and chlorophyll : N ratio of mature leaves were best correlated with the integrated average quantum flux density during leaf development, suggesting that foliar photosynthetic apparatus, once developed, is not affected by day-to-day fluctuations in Qint. However, for the upper canopy leaves of P. tremula and for the entire canopy of T. cordata, there was a continuous decline in N contents per unit dry mass in mature non-senescent leaves on the order of 15\textendash 20\% for a change of leaf age from 40 to 120 d, possibly manifesting nitrogen reallocation to bud formation. The decline in N contents led to similar decreases in leaf photosynthetic capacity and foliar chlorophyll contents. These data demonstrate that light-dependent variation in the rate of developmental changes in MA determines canopy differences in photosynthetic capacity, whereas foliar photosynthetic apparatus is essentially constant in fully developed leaves.},

  abstract = {Plant canopies are characterized by dramatic gradients of light between canopy top and bottom, and interactions between light, temperature and water vapour deficits. This review summarizes current knowledge of potentials and limitations of acclimation of foliage photosynthetic capacity (Amax) and light-harvesting efficiency to complex environmental gradients within the canopies. Acclimation of Amax to high light availability involves accumulation of rate-limiting photosynthetic proteins per unit leaf area as the result of increases in leaf thickness in broad-leaved species and volume : total area ratio and mesophyll thickness in species with complex geometry of leaf cross-section. Enhancement of light-harvesting efficiency in low light occurs through increased chlorophyll production per unit dry mass, greater leaf area per unit dry mass investment in leaves and shoot architectural modifications that improve leaf exposure and reduce within-shoot shading. All these acclimation responses vary among species, resulting in species-specific use efficiencies of low and high light. In fast-growing canopies and in evergreen species, where foliage developed and acclimated to a certain light environment becomes shaded by newly developing foliage, leaf senescence, age-dependent changes in cell wall characteristics and limited foliage re-acclimation capacity can constrain adjustment of older leaves to modified light availabilities. The review further demonstrates that leaves in different canopy positions respond differently to dynamic fluctuations in light availability and to multiple environmental stresses. Foliage acclimated to high irradiance respond more plastically to rapid changes in leaf light environment, and is more resistant to co-occurring heat and water stress. However, in higher light, co-occurring stresses can more strongly curb the efficiency of foliage photosynthetic machinery through reductions in internal diffusion conductance to CO2. This review demonstrates strong foliage potential for acclimation to within-canopy environmental gradients, but also highlights complex constraints on acclimation and foliage functioning resulting from light \texttimes{} foliage age interactions, multiple environmental stresses, dynamic light fluctuations and species-specific leaf and shoot structural constraints.},

  abstract = {Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory offers a perspective on population ecology whose starting point is energy utilization by, and homeostasis within, individual organisms. It is natural to ask what it adds to the existing large body of individual-based ecological theory. We approach this question pragmatically\textemdash through detailed study of the individual physiology and population dynamics of the zooplankter Daphnia and its algal food. Standard DEB theory uses several state variables to characterize the state of an individual organism, thereby making the transition to population dynamics technically challenging, while ecologists demand maximally simple models that can be used in multi-scale modelling. We demonstrate that simpler representations of individual bioenergetics with a single state variable (size), and two life stages (juveniles and adults), contain sufficient detail on mass and energy budgets to yield good fits to data on growth, maturation and reproduction of individual Daphnia in response to food availability. The same simple representations of bioenergetics describe some features of Daphnia mortality, including enhanced mortality at low food that is not explicitly incorporated in the standard DEB model. Size-structured, population models incorporating this additional mortality component resolve some long-standing questions on stability and population cycles in Daphnia. We conclude that a bioenergetic model serving solely as a `regression' connecting organismal performance to the history of its environment can rest on simpler representations than those of standard DEB. But there are associated costs with such pragmatism, notably loss of connection to theory describing interspecific variation in physiological rates. The latter is an important issue, as the type of detailed study reported here can only be performed for a handful of species.},

  abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) dynamics in croplands need to be improved for the increase of food production in subSaharan Africa. Our objective was to investigate the crop residue management in terms of quality and application method to improve soil N dynamics during the period of crop growth in maize croplands with special reference to soil textures in dry tropical agroecosystems. Field experiments were conducted during the rainy seasons of 2012 and 2013 at clayey and sandy sites in Tanzania. Five treatment plots were established: plots with no residue applied (Ctrl plot), chemical fertilizer applied (F plot), maize residue (high C:N ratio = 60) incorporated (M-In plot) or mulched (M-On plot), and cowpea residue (low C:N ratio = 21) incorporated (P-In plot). In each plot, we regularly collected surface soil and crop samples and measured inorganic N (NO3-\textendash N and NH4+\textendash N), the soil respiration rate, and crop N uptake. Rainfall and soil moisture content were also continuously monitored. Our results showed that cowpea residue with high biodegradability caused prompt increases in the soil respiration rate and soil inorganic N because decomposition of the applied residue occurred within ca. 2 weeks after the application at both the clayey and sandy sites. It resulted in high N use efficiency in the early growing period and 18\textendash 73\% higher total crop N uptake than that in the maize residue plots at both sites. The application methods (incorporation and mulching) showed no significant difference in soil N dynamics and crop yield, although higher soil respiration was observed in the M-In plot than the M-On plot at the clayey site. However, at the sandy site, mulching of maize residue resulted in the increased soil inorganic N content in the M-On plot by 18\textendash 26\% compared with that in the M-In plot during the cropping season because of the higher soil moisture content. Consequently, crop N uptake in the mulching plot resulted in 26\textendash 59\% higher than that in the incorporation plot.},

Despite some exceptions, case studies, examined by trade-offs between reproduction and other life-history traits, generally support the predictions of the cost of reproduction hypothesis. The cost of reproduction as an evolutionary determinant of sexual dimorphism in life history traits in dioecious species was specifically tested, considering that the higher cost of reproduction in females has driven the life history traits related to sexual dimorphism. Females of woody dioecious species were consistently smaller than males supporting the costs of reproduction hypothesis. By contrast, females of herbaceous perennials were generally the larger sex, which did not fit the expectations of the hypothesis. Finally, the mechanisms that enable the compensation of the reproductive costs are detailed, including the plastic responses of photosynthesis and growth, the effects of the timing of investment, plant architecture and plant physiological integration.

By considering a large self interaction \$u\$, we conduct a perturbative expansion which manifests that the nature of the interactions has a direct impact on the species abundance distribution. The central results are all species coexistence in a realistic range of the model parameters and that a certain discrete nature of the interactions induces multiple peaks in the species abundance distribution, providing the possibility of theoretically explaining multiple peaks observed in various field studies. To get more quantitative information, we also construct a non-perturbative theory which becomes exact on tree-like networks if all the species coexist, providing exact critical values of \$u\$ below which extinct species emerge. Numerical simulations in various different situations are conducted and they clarify the robustness of the presented mechanism of all species coexistence and multiple peaks in the species abundance distributions.},

Although broad trade-offs among leaf structural and physiological traits have been demonstrated, we still do not have a comprehensive view of the fundamental constraints underlying the LES trade-offs. Here, we investigated physiological and structural mechanisms underpinning the LES by analysing a novel data compilation incorporating rarely considered traits such as the dry mass fraction in cell walls, nitrogen allocation, mesophyll CO2 diffusion and associated anatomical traits for hundreds of species covering major growth forms. The analysis demonstrates that cell wall constituents are major components of leaf dry mass (18\textendash 70\%), especially in leaves with high leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and long lifespan. A greater fraction of leaf mass in cell walls is typically associated with a lower fraction of leaf nitrogen (N) invested in photosynthetic proteins; and lower within-leaf CO2 diffusion rates, as a result of thicker mesophyll cell walls. The costs associated with greater investments in cell walls underpin the LES: long leaf lifespans are achieved via higher LMA and in turn by higher cell wall mass fraction, but this inevitably reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis.},

Long-term records show that insect abundance has declined significantly over this time, with worrying implications for terrestrial ecosystems. The majority of investigations into the vulnerability of nocturnal insects to artificial light have focused on the flight-to-light behavior exhibited by select insect families. However, ALAN can affect insects in other ways as well. This review proposes five categories of ALAN impact on nocturnal insects, highlighting past research and identifying key knowledge gaps. We conclude with a summary of relevant literature on bioluminescent fireflies, which emphasizes the unique vulnerability of terrestrial light-based communication systems to artificial illumination. Comprehensive understanding of the ecological impacts of ALAN on diverse nocturnal insect taxa will enable researchers to seek out methods whereby fireflies, moths, and other essential members of the nocturnal ecosystem can coexist with humans on an increasingly urbanized planet.},

  abstract = {Light is a crucial environmental cue not only for photosynthetic energy production but also for plant growth and development. Plants employ sophisticated methods to detect and interpret information from incoming light. Five classes of photoreceptors have been discovered in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These photoreceptors act either distinctly and/or redundantly in fine-tuning many aspects of plant life cycle. Unlike mobile animals, sessile plants have developed an enormous plasticity to adapt and survive in changing environment. By monitoring different information arising from ambient light, plants precisely regulate downstream signaling pathways to adapt accordingly. Given that changes in the light environment is typically synchronized with other environmental cues such as temperature, abiotic stresses, and seasonal changes, it is not surprising that light signaling pathways are interconnected with multiple pathways to regulate plant physiology and development. Indeed, recent advances in plant photobiology revealed a large network of co-regulation among different photoreceptor signaling pathways as well as other internal signaling pathways (e.g., hormone signaling). In addition, some photoreceptors are directly involved in perception of non-light stimuli (e.g., temperature). Therefore, understanding highly inter-connected signaling networks is essential to explore the photoreceptor functions in plants. Here, we summarize how plants co-ordinate multiple photoreceptors and their internal signaling pathways to regulate a myriad of downstream responses at molecular and physiological levels.},

For many decades, the mean growth rate of a species when it is rare has been employed as an invasion criterion. Recent studies show that the mean growth rate fails as a quantitative metric for invasibility, with its magnitude sometimes even increasing while the invasibility decreases. Here we provide two novel formulae, based on the diffusion approximation and a large-deviations (Wentzel\textendash Kramers\textendash Brillouin) approach, for the chance of invasion given the mean growth and its variance. The first formula has the virtue of simplicity, while the second one holds over a wider parameter range. The efficacy of the formulae, including their accompanying data analysis technique, is demonstrated using synthetic time series generated from canonical models and parameterised with empirical data.},

  abstract = {Premise Does the seed size\textendash seed number allocation trade-off model apply to long-term persistent soil seed banks? This trade-off between seed size versus number of seeds produced is usually applied at a single population on an annual basis. Our question is how this model might apply to close relatives that produce dormant seed forming long-term persistent soil seed banks. These two criteria allow a focus on divergent evolution of conspecifics and permits us to isolate seed size in the spectrum of life history traits that may be influencing seed traits, and on how seed size influences accumulation and persistence in the soil. Methods In California, Arctostaphylos species only produce physiologically dormant seed that are fire-stimulated and that vary in seed size permitting seed size\textendash seed bank density relationship as a test of the seed size\textendash seed number allocation model. Soil seed banks of 10 species of Arctostaphylos were sampled with fruit volumes ranging from 21\textendash 1063 mm3. Seed bank density was determined by hand extraction from soil samples. Results We found that seed bank densities were significantly negatively related to fruit or seed size. Conclusions Rather than an issue of allocational trade-off between size and number, we interpret these results as reflecting seed predation and postfire seedling establishment. Seed bank densities, even after decades, generally were less than one or two-year's seed production, suggesting intense seed predation. Burial by scatter-hoarding rodents provided sufficient seeds deep enough for survival of fire. Variation on seed size suggests seedling establishment constraints, but it needs further research.},

  abstract = {The choice of the best sampling strategy to capture mean values of functional traits for a species/population, while maintaining information about traits' variability and minimizing the sampling size and effort, is an open issue in functional trait ecology. Intraspecific variability (ITV) of functional traits strongly influences sampling size and effort. However, while adequate information is available about intraspecific variability between individuals (ITVBI) and among populations (ITVPOP), relatively few studies have analyzed intraspecific variability within individuals (ITVWI). Here, we provide an analysis of ITVWI of two foliar traits, namely specific leaf area (SLA) and osmotic potential ({$\pi$}), in a population of Quercus ilex L. We assessed the baseline ITVWI level of variation between the two traits and provided the minimum and optimal sampling size in order to take into account ITVWI, comparing sampling optimization outputs with those previously proposed in the literature. Different factors accounted for different amount of variance of the two traits. SLA variance was mostly spread within individuals (43.4\% of the total variance), while {$\pi$} variance was mainly spread between individuals (43.2\%). Strategies that did not account for all the canopy strata produced mean values not representative of the sampled population. The minimum size to adequately capture the studied functional traits corresponded to 5 leaves taken randomly from 5 individuals, while the most accurate and feasible sampling size was 4 leaves taken randomly from 10 individuals. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of the canopy could significantly affect traits variability. Moreover, different strategies for different traits could be implemented during sampling surveys. We partially confirm sampling sizes previously proposed in the recent literature and encourage future analysis involving different traits.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests are the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems and home to numerous tree species competing for resources in space and time. Functional traits influence the ecophysiological performance of tree species, yet the relationship between traits and emergent long-term growth patterns is poorly understood. Here, we present a novel 3D forest stand model in which growth patterns of individual trees and forest stands are emergent properties of leaf traits. Individual trees are simulated as 3D functional-structural tree models (FSTMs), considering branches up to the second order and leaf dynamics at a resolution of one cubic meter. Each species is characterized by a set of leaf traits that corresponds to a specific position on the leaf economics spectrum and determines light-driven carbon assimilation, respiration and mortality rates. Applying principles of the pipe model theory, these leaf scale processes are coupled with within-tree carbon allocation, i.e., 3D tree growth emerges from low-level processes. By integrating these FSTMs into a dynamic forest stand model, we go beyond modern stand models to integrate structurally detailed internal physiological processes with interspecific competition and interactions with the environment in diverse tree communities. For model calibration and validation, we simultaneously compared a large number of emergent patterns at both the tree and forest levels in a pattern-oriented modelling framework. At the tree level, the specific leaf area and correlated leaf traits determined the maximum height and age of trees, as well as their size-dependent growth rate and shade tolerance. Trait variations along the leaf economics spectrum led to a continuous transition from fast-growing, short-lived and shade-intolerant to slow-growing, long-lived and shade-tolerant trees. These emerging patterns resemble well-known functional tree types, indicating a fundamental impact of leaf traits on long-term growth patterns. At the forest level, a large number of patterns taken from lowland Neotropical forests were reproduced, indicating that our forest model simulates structurally realistic forests over long time spans. Our ecophysiological approach improves the understanding of how leaf level processes scale up to the tree and the stand level, and facilitates the development of next-generation forest models for species-rich forests in which tree performance emerges directly from functional traits.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the leaf disc method for estimating the leaf area index (LAI) of soybean plants in comparison with the digital photo method. A split-plot experimental design was used with three replications. The LAIs calculated by the leaf disc and digital photo methods were compared at four growth stages in four soybean cultivars (subplot). These soybean cultivars were sowed in Guarapuava, Paran\'a State, Brazil, at three different sowing dates (main plot) in the 2010/2011 growing season. Regression analysis was used for each group of samples, and the efficiency of the leaf disc method was evaluated on the basis of the coefficient of determination (R{$^2$}), the calculated F and the intersection and abscissa errors. The regression analysis that compared the two methods resulted in highly significant F values and low errors for all sample groups, which showed the effectiveness of the leaf disc method. Although the R2 value was high for all of the analyses, the values were minor for the separate growth stage analysis, especially for the samples collected at the V9 and R2 stages. The results indicated that the specific leaf area calculated by the leaf disc method was lesser to the specific leaf area calculated by the digital photo method. The leaf disc method is an efficient and robust method for estimating the LAI of soybean plants.},

  abstract = {The interaction of shortwave radiation with vegetation drives basic processes of the biosphere, such as primary productivity, species interactions through light competition, and energy fluxes between the atmosphere, vege\- tation, and soil. Here, we aim to understand the effects of leaf functional trait diversity on canopy light ab\- sorption. We focus on the diversity of three key functional traits that influence the light-canopy interaction: leaf area index (LAI), leaf angle distribution (LAD) and leaf optical properties (LOP). We used a 3D radiative transfer model to perform an in-silico biodiversity experiment to study the effects of leaf functional diversity on a light proxy for productivity (the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR)) and net radiation (shortwave albedo). We found that diverse canopies had lower albedo and higher FAPAR than the average of the corresponding monoculture values. In mixtures, FAPAR was unequally re-distributed between trees with distinct traits: some plant functional types absorbed more light and some plant functional types absorbed less than in monocultures. The net biodiversity effect on absorptance was greater when combining plant functional types with more distinct leaf traits. Our results support the mechanistic understanding of overyielding effects in functionally diverse canopies and may partially explain some of the growth-promoting mechanisms in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments. They can further help to account for biodiversity effects in climate models.},

  abstract = {Here, we analysed a wide range of literature data on the leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA). In nature, LMA varies more than 100-fold among species. Part of this variation (c. 35\%) can be ascribed to differences between functional groups, with evergreen species having the highest LMA, but most of the variation is within groups or biomes. When grown in the same controlled environment, leaf succulents and woody evergreen, perennial or slow-growing species have inherently high LMA. Within most of the functional groups studied, high-LMA species show higher leaf tissue densities. However, differences between evergreen and deciduous species result from larger volumes per area (thickness). Response curves constructed from experiments under controlled conditions showed that LMA varied strongly with light, temperature and submergence, moderately with CO2 concentration and nutrient and water stress, and marginally under most other conditions. Functional groups differed in the plasticity of LMA to these gradients. The physiological regulation is still unclear, but the consequences of variation in LMA and the suite of traits interconnected with it are strong. This trait complex is an important factor determining the fitness of species in their environment and affects various ecosystem processes. Contents Summary 565 I. LMA in perspective 566 II.

  abstract = {Viruses have evolved different life strategies for coping with environmental challenges and this is a key explanation for their omnipresence in aquatic systems. However, factors that determine the balance between lytic versus lysogenic decision within natural virioplankton are poorly documented, primarily in freshwaters. This study was designed to investigate the experimental short-term (24 h incubation) effects of added organic and inorganic nutrients on the two viral lifestyles in nutrient-depleted freshwater microbial (i.e. {$<$} 0.8 {$\mu$}m fraction) microcosms, using mitomycin C as prophage inductor agent. In the absence of mitomycin, viral lytic production increased as a functional response to the strong stimulation of bacterial growth rates (0.7\textendash 0.8 day-1) by the added nutrients, primarily the organic nutrients which appeared scarcer than inorganic nutrients and was related to the sampling period and the geomorphological peculiarities of Lake Pavin. In the presence of mitomycin, temperate phage production (frequency of lysogenically infected bacterial cells, FLC = 17\textendash 19\% of total cells) significantly exceeded lytic production (frequency of lytically infected bacterial cells, FIC = 9\textendash 11\%) in natural samples (i.e. without nutrient additions) as a result of enhanced prophage induction, which relatively increased with the decreasing contact probability between viruses and their potential hosts. In contrast, addition of nutrients drastically reduced FLC ({$<$} 4\%) and increased FIC ({$>$} 22\%). Both variables were antagonistically correlated as was the correlation between FLC and bacterial growth rates, supporting the idea that lysogeny may represent a maintenance strategy for viruses in harsh nutrient/host conditions which appeared as major instigators of the trade-off between the two viral lifestyles. Overall, at the community level, we reject the hypothesis that nutrients but mitomicyn C stimulate temperate phage induction, and retained the hypotheses that nutrients rather (i) stimulate lytic viruses via enhanced host growth and (ii) when limiting, promote lysogenic conversion in natural waters.},

We evaluated whether leaf traits were reliable predictors of the effects of leaf ageing and leaf irradiance on leaf photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax, Jmax) in field-grown vines (Vitis vinifera L). Simultaneously, we measured gas exchange, leaf mass per area (LMA) and nitrogen content (Nm) of leaves at different positions within the canopy and at different phenological stages. Daily mean leaf irradiance cumulated over 10 d (PPFD10) was obtained by 3D modelling of the canopy structure. Nm decreased over the season in parallel to leaf ageing while LMA was mainly affected by leaf position. PPFD10 explained 66, 28 and 73\% of the variation of LMA, Nm and nitrogen content per area (Na), respectively. Nitrogen content per unit area (Na = LMA \texttimes{} Nm) was the best predictor of the intra-canopy variability of leaf photosynthetic capacity. Finally, we developed a classical photosynthesis-stomatal conductance submodel and by introducing Na as an input, the model accurately simulated the daily pattern of gas exchange for leaves at different positions in the canopy and at different phenological stages during the season.},

Usually, the main goal of ecological restoration is to restore biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but validation is often based on a single indicator, which may or may not cope with whole-ecosystem dynamics. Network analyses are, however, powerful tools, allowing to examine both the recovery of various biotic and abiotic properties and the integrated response at community and ecosystem level. We used restoration sites where topsoil was removed from former intensively managed grassland and seeds were added. These sites were between 3 to 32 years old. We assessed how plants, soil biota, soil properties, and correlation-based interactions between biotic communities and their abiotic environment developed over time and compared the results with (i) intensively managed (not restored), and (ii) well-preserved targeted semi-natural grasslands. Plant, nematode, fungal, and prokaryotic diversity and community structures of the restored grasslands revealed clear successional patterns and followed similar trajectories towards targeted semi-natural grasslands. All biotic communities reached targeted diversity levels no later than 18 years post restoration. Ecological networks of intensively managed and short-term ( 4 years) restored grasslands were less tightly connected compared to those found in mid- and long-term ( 18-30 years) restored and target grasslands. Restoration specifically enhanced interactions among biotic communities, but reduced interactions between biotic communities and their abiotic environment as well as interactions among abiotic properties in the short- and mid-term. Synthesis and applications: Overall, our study demonstrated that topsoil removal and seed addition were successful in restoring diverse, tightly coupled and well-connected biotic communities above- and belowground similar to those found in the semi-natural grasslands that were restoration targets. Network analyses proved to be powerful in examining the long-term re-establishment of functionally connected biotic communities in restored ecosystems. Thus, we provide an approach to holistically assess restoration activities by notably considering the complexity of ecosystems, much in contrast to most traditional approaches.},

Light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (Amax), nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl) content and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) were measured in leaves of trees of different heights along a natural light gradient in a French Guiana rain forest. The following four species, arranged in order from most shade-tolerant to pioneer, were studied: Duguetia surinamensis, Vouacapoua americana, Dicorynia guianensis and Goupia glabra. Light availability of trees was estimated using hemispherical photography. 2. The pioneer species Goupia had the lowest LMA and leaf N on both an area and mass basis, whereas Duguetia had the highest values. In general, leaf variables of Vouacapoua and Dicorynia tended to be intermediates. Because Amax/area was similar among species, Goupia showed both a much higher light-saturated photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) and Amax/mass. Leaves of Vouacapoua demonstrated the greatest plasticity in Amax/area, particularly in small saplings. 3. A distinction could be made between the effect of tree height and light availability on the structural, i.e. LMA, and photosynthetic leaf characteristics of all four species. The direction and magnitude of the variation in variables were similar among species. 4. LMA was the key variable that mainly determined variation in the other leaf variables along tree height and light availability gradients, with the exception of changes in chlorophyll concentration. Amax/area, N/area, LMA and stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) increased, whereas Chl/mass decreased, with both increasing tree height and canopy openness. Amax/mass, PNUEmax and Amax/Chl increased with increasing openness only. N/mass and Chl/area were independent of tree height and openness, except for small saplings of Goupia which had a much lower Chl/area.},

  abstract = {Leaf mass per area (LMA) is a morphological trait widely used as a good indicator of plant functioning (i.e. photosynthetic and respiratory rates, chemical composition, resistance to herbivory, etc.). The LMA can be broken down into the leaf density (LD) and leaf volume to area ratio (LVA or thickness), which in turn are determined by anatomical tissues and chemical composition. The aim of this study is to understand the anatomical and chemical characteristics related to LMA variation in species growing in the field along a water availability gradient. We determined LMA and its components (LD, LVA and anatomical tissues) for 34 Mediterranean (20 evergreen and 14 deciduous) woody species. Variation in LMA was due to variation in both LD and LVA. For both deciduous and evergreen species LVA variation was strongly and positively related with mesophyll volume per area (VA or thickness), but for evergreen species positive relationships of LVA with the VA of epidermis, vascular plus sclerenchyma tissues and air spaces were found as well. The leaf carbon concentration was positively related with mesophyll VA in deciduous species, and with VA of vascular plus sclerenchymatic tissues in evergreens. Species occurring at the sites with lower water availability were generally characterised by a high LMA and LD.},

The EFP states that all organisms are equally fit at steady state, because they allocate the same quantity of energy, 22.4 kJ/g/generation to the production of offspring. On the one hand, the EFP may seem tautological, because equal fitness is necessary for the origin and persistence of biodiversity. On the other hand, the EFP reflects universal laws of life: how biological metabolism \textendash{} the uptake, transformation and allocation of energy \textendash{} links ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes across levels of organisation from: (1) structure and function of individual organisms, (2) life history and dynamics of populations, and (3) interactions and coevolution of species in ecosystems. The physics and biology of metabolism have facilitated the evolution of millions of species with idiosyncratic anatomy, physiology, behaviour and ecology but also with many shared traits and tradeoffs that reflect the single origin and universal rules of life.},

Does habitat diversity support species diversity, or is it the other way around? What reduces diversity in ecologically productive places? At what scales of space and time do diversity patterns hold? Do the mechanisms that produce them vary with scale? This book examines these questions and many others, by employing both theory and data in the search for answers. Surprisingly, many of the questions have reasonably likely answers. By identifying these, attention can be turned toward life's many, still-unexplained diversity patterns. As evolutionary ecologists race to understand biodiversity before it is too late, this book will help set the agenda for diversity research into the next century.},

  abstract = {Leaf mass per area (M\^) is a central ecological trait that is intercorrelated with leaf life span, photosjnthetic rate, nutrient concentration, and palatability to herbivores. These coordinated variables form a globally convergent leaf economics spectrum, which represents a general continuum running from rapid resource acquisition to maximized resource retention. Leaf economics are little studied in ancient ecosystems because they cannot be directly measured from leaf fossils. Here we use a large extant data set (65 sites; 667 species-site pairs) to develop a new, easily measured scaling relationship between petiole width and leaf mass, normalized for leaf area; this enables M\^ estimation for fossil leaves from petiole width and leaf area, two variables that are commonly measurable in leaf compression floras. The calibration data are restricted to woody angiosperms exclusive of monocots, but a preliminary data set (25 species) suggests that broad-leaved gymnosperms exhibit a similar scaling. Application to two well-studied, classic Eocene floras demonstrates that M\^ can be quantified in fossil assemblages. First, our results are consistent with predictions from paleobotanical and paleoclimatic studies of these floras. We found exclusively low-M\^ species from Republic (Washington, U.S.A., 49 Ma), a humid, warm-temperate flora with a strong deciduous component among the angiosperms, and a wide M\^ range in a seasonally dry, warm-temperate flora from the Green River Formation at Bonanza (Utah, U.S.A, 47 Ma), presumed to comprise a mix of short and long leaf life spans. Second, reconstructed M\^ in the fossil species is negatively correlated with levels of insect herbivory, whether measured as the proportion of leaves with insect damage, the proportion of leaf area removed by herbivores, or the diversity of insect-damage morphotypes. These correlations are consistent with herbivory observations in extant floras and they reflect fundamental trade-offs in plant-herbivore associations. Our results indicate that several key aspects of plant and plant-animal ecology can now be quantified in the fossil record and demonstrate that herbivory has helped shape the evolution of leaf structure for millions of years.},

  abstract = {Life has evolved to internalize and depend upon the daily and seasonal light cycles to synchronize physiology and behavior with environmental conditions. The nightscape has been vastly changed in response to the use of artificial lighting. Wildlife is now often exposed to direct lighting via streetlights or indirect lighting via sky glow at night. Because many activities rely on daily and seasonal light cues, the effects of artificial light at night could be extensive, but remain largely unknown. Laboratory studies suggest exposure to light at night can alter typical timing of daily locomotor activity and shift the timing of foraging/food intake to the daytime in nocturnal rodents. Additionally, nocturnal rodents decrease anxiety-like behaviors (i.e., spend more time in the open and increase rearing up) in response to even dim light at night. These are all likely maladaptive responses in the wild. Photoperiodic animals rely on seasonal changes in day length as a cue to evoke physiological and behavioral modifications to anticipate favorable and unfavorable conditions for survival and reproduction. Light at night can mask detection of short days, inappropriately signal long days, and thus desynchronize seasonal reproductive activities. We review laboratory and the sparse field studies that address the effects of exposure to artificial light at night to propose that exposure to light at night disrupts circadian and seasonal behavior in wildlife, which potentially decreases individual fitness and modifies ecosystems.},

Plant species that grow fast in high light usually have high mortality in shade, and this well-established relationship in part defines a species' successional niche. More generally, this relationship represents a trade-off between a species' ability to grow quickly to exploit abundant resources vs. avoiding mortality when resources are less plentiful, but few studies have described this demographic trade-off with respect to environmental factors other than light. 2 Using demographic data from 960 tree species in Bornean rain forest, we examined the evidence for an interspecific demographic trade-off between fast growth and low mortality and its variation among habitats defined by variation in soil fertility and moisture. Such a trade-off could contribute to sorting of tree species among habitats and partly explain the striking patterns of species' edaphic associations in this and other forests. 3 We found strong evidence for this demographic trade-off, both within the same habitat and when growth on edaphically rich habitats was compared with mortality on a habitat with lower below-ground resource availability. 4 The slope of the growth-mortality relationship varied among habitats, being steepest on the habitat lowest in below-ground resources. For species with the fastest potential growth rates, mortality was higher on this habitat than at comparable growth rates on the three more edaphically rich habitats, providing a possible mechanism by which fast-growing species may be eliminated from the poorest habitat. Adaptations for fast growth may entail a greater mortality risk, if inherently fast-growing species fail to maintain a positive C-balance when below-ground resources are scarce. 5 Conversely, for species with the slowest potential growth rates, the highest species' mortality rates occurred on the habitats with greatest below-ground resource availability, implying that slow-growing species may have a competitive disadvantage in resource-rich environments. 6 Synthesis.

  abstract = {Leaf vein traits are implicated in the determination of gas exchange rates and plant performance. These traits are increasingly considered as causal factors affecting the `leaf economic spectrum' (LES), which includes the lightsaturated rate of photosynthesis, dark respiration, foliar nitrogen concentration, leaf dry mass per area (LMA) and leaf longevity. This article reviews the support for two contrasting hypotheses regarding a key vein trait, vein length per unit leaf area (VLA). Recently, Blonder et al. (2011, 2013) proposed that vein traits, including VLA, can be described as the `origin' of the LES by structurally determining LMA and leaf thickness, and thereby vein traits would predict LES traits according to specific equations. Careful re-examination of leaf anatomy, published datasets, and a newly compiled global database for diverse species did not support the `vein origin' hypothesis, and moreover showed that the apparent power of those equations to predict LES traits arose from circularity. This review provides a `flux trait network' hypothesis for the effects of vein traits on the LES and on plant performance, based on a synthesis of the previous literature. According to this hypothesis, VLA, while virtually independent of LMA, strongly influences hydraulic conductance, and thus stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate. We also review (i) the specific physiological roles of VLA; (ii) the role of leaf major veins in influencing LES traits; and (iii) the role of VLA in determining photosynthetic rate per leaf dry mass and plant relative growth rate. A clear understanding of leaf vein traits provides a new perspective on plant function independently of the LES and can enhance the ability to explain and predict whole plant performance under dynamic conditions, with applications towards breeding improved crop varieties.},

Here we focus on allocation tradeoffs, in which acquisition of a limiting resource requires allocation of resource to alternative traits. We identify the components of this allocation process and emphasize the importance of quantifying them. We then propose categorizing allocation tradeoffs into linear, concave and convex relationships based on the way that resource allocation yields trait magnitudes under the tradeoff. Linear relationships are over-represented in the literature because of typically small data sets over restricted ranges of trait magnitudes, an emphasis on simple correlation analysis, and a failure to remove variation associated with acquisition of the limiting resource in characterizing the tradeoff. (We provide methods for controlling these acquisition effects.) Non-linear relationships have been documented and are expected under plausible conditions that we summarize.

  abstract = {The evolutionarily stable size of attractive structures of a flower was analyzed theoretically to examine the factors that select for the differences in the size of attractive structures of a flower depending on the sexuality and self-fertilization rate. In the first analysis, it was assumed that the size\textendash number trade-off for flowers is non-linear (the size of individual flowers increases less rapidly than in a linear trade-off with a decrease in the number of flowers, as would occur during a linear trade-off) and the frequency of pollinator visits per flower depends on the size of attractive structures of individual flowers, but is independent of the number of flowers on the plant. In this case the size of attractive structures is larger in male flowers than in female flowers in dioecious plants, and this size decreases with an increase in the self-fertilization rate for hermaphroditic plants (where both are consistent with the general trends observed). In the second analysis, it was assumed that the size\textendash number trade-off for flowers is linear and the frequency of pollinator visits per flower depends not only on the size of attractive structures of individual flowers, but also on the number of flowers on the plant. However, the results were inconsistent with the general trends in this case; namely, that the size of the attractive structures is smaller in male flowers than in female flowers in dioecious plants, and this size increases with an increase in self-fertilization rate for hermaphroditic plants. I therefore conclude that the non-linearity in size\textendash number trade-offs for flowers is a more useful factor to use to explain the general trends in the size of attractive structures of a flower. This also suggests that the attractive function hypothesis, that is, the differences in fitness gains through allocation to attractive structures between males and females and among plants with different self-fertilization rates, are important factors, but alone cannot explain the general trends.},

Life history theory predicts that the evolution of floral display is constrained by trade-offs between the size and number of flowers and inflorescences. Indeed, a trade-off between flower size and flower number is a key assumption of models of inflorescence architecture and the evolution of floral display. Surprisingly, however, empirical evidence for the trade-off is limited. In particular, there is a lack of phylogenetic evidence for a trade-off between flower size and number. Analyses of phylogenetic independent contrasts (PICs) of 251 angiosperm species spanning 63 families yielded a significant negative correlation between flower size and flower number. At smaller phylogenetic scales, analyses of individual genera did not always find evidence of a trade-off, a result consistent with previous studies that have examined the trade-off for a single species or genus. Ours is the first study to support an angiosperm-wide trade-off between flower size and number and supports the theory that life history constraints have influenced the evolution of floral display.},

In this study, we investigated leaf thermotolerance by quantifying the temperatures that resulted in a 50 \% decrease in photosystem II function (T50) in experimentally grown saplings of 12 tree species from a s\- easonally dry tropical forest. We examined the relationship of thermotolerance with leaf functional traits and photosynthetic rates. Additionally, we tested how water limitation altered thermotolerance within species, and examined the \-relationship between thermotolerance and drought tolerance among species. Thermotolerance ranged from 44.5 to 48.1 \textdegree C in the least and most thermotolerant species, respectively. The observed variation in thermotolerance indicates that the upper limits of leaf function are critically close to maximum temperatures in this region, and that these species will be vulnerable to, and differentially affected by, future warming. Drought increased temperature tolerance, and species that were more drought tolerant were also more thermotolerant. Importantly, thermotolerance was positively related to the key leaf functional trait\textemdash leaf mass per area (LMA), and congruent with this, negatively related to photosynthetic rates. These results indicate that more productive species with lower LMA and higher photosynthetic rates may be more vulnerable to heat and drought stress, and more likely to be negatively affected by future increases in extreme climatic events.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is a key trait of species enabling gene flow among populations. For species persistence dispersal may therefore be crucial especially in a patchy or changing environment. Tree hollows are a patchy habitat as their number is locally limited and in addition to that, habitat quality of tree hollows differs. Both factors are important for colonization by saproxylic insects as species may be specialized on a particular age or quality of a tree hollow and may be dispersal-limited. Intensive forest management may further decrease the number of tree hollows and increase distances between them, if trees with hollows are removed. However, not much is known about the dispersal abilities of most saproxylic species, even though such knowledge could improve conservation efforts. To investigate the genetic population structure of saproxylic species, we collected saproxylic organisms with emergence traps from 40 hollows in beech trees in a managed forest in Germany (approximately 14 \texttimes{} 14 km). We focused on three threatened species, one coleopteran and two dipteran (Anaspis ruficollis, Scraptiidae; Criorhina floccosa, Syrphidae; Xylomya maculata, Xylomyidae) emerging from our tree hollows. Microsatellite analysis was used to assess gene flow among tree hollows and population genetic structure. In contrast to other studies reporting limited dispersal in saproxylic insects, we found no indication for restricted gene flow in all three species investigated. However, we studied relatively abundant species and our study site may not have been large enough to detect genetic substructure. This study indicates that the amount and quality of a suitable habitat may at least in some cases be more limiting than the physical ability to disperse.},

  abstract = {In 2018, Central Europe experienced one of the most severe and long-lasting summer drought and heat wave ever recorded. Before 2018, the 2003 millennial drought was often invoked as the example of a ``hotter drought'', and was classified as the most severe event in Europe for the last 500 years. First insights now confirm that the 2018 drought event was climatically more extreme and had a greater impact on forest ecosystems of Austria, Germany and Switzerland than the 2003 drought. Across this region, mean growing season air temperature from April to October was more than 3.3\textdegree C above the long-term average, and 1.2\textdegree C warmer than in 2003. Here, we present a first impact assessment of the severe 2018 summer drought and heatwave on Central European forests. In response to the 2018 event, most ecologically and economically important tree species in temperate forests of Austria, Germany and Switzerland showed severe signs of drought stress. These symptoms included exceptionally low foliar water potentials crossing the threshold for xylem hydraulic failure in many species and observations of widespread leaf discoloration and premature leaf shedding. As a result of the extreme drought stress, the 2018 event caused unprecedented drought-induced tree mortality in many species throughout the region. Moreover, unexpectedly strong drought-legacy effects were detected in 2019. This implies that the physiological recovery of trees was impaired after the 2018 drought event, leaving them highly vulnerable to secondary drought impacts such as insect or fungal pathogen attacks. As a consequence, mortality of trees triggered by the 2018 events is likely to continue for several years. Our assessment indicates that many common temperate European forest tree species are more vulnerable to extreme summer drought and heat waves than previously thought. As drought and heat events are likely to occur more frequently with the progression of climate change, temperate European forests might approach the point for a substantial ecological and economic transition. Our assessment also highlights the urgent need for a pan-European ground-based monitoring network suited to track individual tree mortality, supported by remote sensing products with high spatial and temporal resolution to track, analyse and forecast these transitions.},

  abstract = {Dionaea is a highly specialized carnivorous plant species with a unique mechanism for insect capture. The leaf is converted into an osmotically driven trap that closes when an insect triggers sensory trichomes. This study investigates the significance of insect capture for growth of Dionaea at different successional stages after a fire, under conditions where the prey is highly variable in its isotope signature. The contribution of insect-derived nitrogen (N) was estimated using the natural abundance of 15N. In contrast to previous 15N studies on carnivorous plants, the problem emerges that d15N values of prey insects ranged between \`A4.47\`u (grasshoppers) and q7.21\`u (ants), a range that exceeds the d15N values of non carnivorous reference plants (\`A4.2\`u) and soils (q3\`u). Thus, the isotope-mixing model used by Shearer and Kohl to estimate the amount of insect-derived N is not applicable. In a novel approach, the relationships of d15N values of different organs with d15N of trapping leaves were used to estimate N partitioning within the plant. It is estimated that soon after fire approximately 75\% of the nitrogen is obtained from insects, regardless of plant size or developmental stage. The estimates are verified by calculating the average isotope signatures of insects from an isotope mass balance and comparing this with the average measured d15N values of insects. It appears that for Dionaea to survive and reach the flowering stage, seedlings must first reach the 6th-leaf rosette stage, in which trap surface area nearly doubles and facilitates the capture of large insects. Large amounts of nitrogen thus made available to plants may facilitate an enhanced growth rate and the progressive production of additional large traps. Dionaea reaches a maximum abundance after fire when growth of the competing vegetation is suppressed. About 10 years after fire, when grasses and shrubs recover, Dionaea becomes overtopped by other species. This would not only reduce carbon assimilation but also the probability of catching larger prey. The amount of insect-derived nitrogen decreases to 46\%, and Dionaea becomes increasingly dependent on N-supply from the soil. Competition for both light and N may cause the near disappearance of Dionaea in older stages of the fire succession.},

We constructed a finite, spatially explicit, lottery model to simulate the distribution of species in a one-dimensional landscape with an underlying gradient in environmental conditions. Our framework combines the potential for ecological drift with environmentally-mediated competition for space in a heterogeneous environment. We examined the influence of niche breadth, dispersal distances, community size (total number of individuals) and the breadth of the environmental gradient on levels of species and functional trait diversity (i.e. differences in niche optima). Three novel results emerge from this model: (1) niche differences between adjacent species (e.g. limiting similarity) increase in smaller communities, because of the interaction of competitive effects and finite population sizes; (2) immigration from a regional species pool, stochasticity and niche-assembly generate a bimodal distribution of species residence times (`transient' and `resident') under a heterogeneous environment; and (3) the magnitude of environmental heterogeneity has a U-shaped effect on diversity, because of shifts in species richness of resident vs. transient species. These predictions illustrate the potential importance of stochastic (although not necessarily neutral) processes in community assembly.},

Sand particles in the soil were lower in planted site than barren site. The reverse trend was found in case of both silt and clay percentage. Coastal afforestation had a significant effect on soil binding process since a common trend of increment in soil particle density was noticed. Maximum increment (20.43\% to 23.30\%) in soil moisture content was recorded in surface soil across the seaside while at subsurface soil both across the middle part (19.53\% to 22.30\%) and sea side (20.19\% to 22.96\%). Moreover, the highest reduction in soil pH was recorded at surface soil (7.27 to 6.60) across the sea side and subsurface soil (7.16 to 6.67) in inland due to the influence of coastal plantation. Across all the land strips and the soil depths studied, soil organic carbon was higher in planted site than in barren site with only exception at subsurface soil in the middle part (0.50\% in both sites). Total soil nitrogen in the study area was increased at both depths due to forestation with the highest increment in the inland at both surface and subsurface soil.},

Although competition and predation are known to act simultaneously in communities, theory and empirical study of these processes continue to be developed largely independently. Here, we integrate modern coexistence theory and food web theory to simultaneously quantify the relative importance of predation and environmental fluctuations for species coexistence. We first examine coexistence in a theoretical, multitrophic model, adding complexity to the food web using machine learning approaches. We then apply our framework to a stochastic model of the rocky intertidal food web, partitioning empirical coexistence dynamics. We find the main effects of both environmental fluctuations and variation in predator abundances contribute substantially to species coexistence. Unexpectedly, their interaction tends to destabilise coexistence, leading to new insights about the role of bottom-up vs. top-down forces in both theory and the rocky intertidal ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Mathematical techniques have a long and rich history in ecology, often serving as a virtual laboratory to test hypotheses, generate novel predictions, and investigate underlying ecological mechanisms. Recently, novel simulation techniques, advances in computing power, and numerical methods for implementing statistical models have significantly advanced our ability to integrate empirical and theoretical ecology. However, a divide still remains between mathematical and empirical studies, their readership, and integration into the broader literature. Because insights from mathematical ecology are far more general than the techniques employed, limitations in communicating mathematical advances to a broad spectrum of ecologists have arguably hindered ecology's progress, particularly in confronting theoretical predictions with empirical experiments and data. Here, we present a guide for both authors and readers of mathematical ecology, with the aim of increasing the accessibility of mathematical ecology for a broad group of ecologists. We provide a list of best practices when both writing and reading mathematical ecology, incorporating examples from this Special Feature of Ecosphere. This guide complements current guides for writing science, focusing specifically on effective communication of mathematics.},

However, due to urbanization, and human development activities lot of excess light generated in environment during night time and responsible for anthropogenic generated pollution (ALAN; artificial night light pollution). This pollution has cause for serious problem in plants as it affects their processes and functions which are under the control of light or diurnal cycle. Plant biorhythms mostly diurnal rhythms such as stomatal movements, photosynthetic activity, and many more metabolic processes are under the control of period of light and dark, which are crucially affected by artificial light at night. Similarly, the crucial plant processes such as pollination, flowering, and yield determining processes are controlled by the diurnal cycle and ALAN affects these processes and ultimately hampers the plant fitness and development. To keep in mind the effect of artificial light at night on plant biorhythm and eco-physiological processes, this chapter will focus on the status of global artificial night light pollution and the responsible factors. Further, we will explore the details mechanisms of plant biorhythm and eco-physiological processes under artificial light at night and how this mechanism can be a global threat. Then at the end we will focus on the ANLP reducing strategies such as new light policy, advanced lightening technology such as remote sensing and lightening utilisation optimisation.},

  abstract = {Modern coexistence theory (MCT) holds the potential to study the ability of species to avoid extinction (i.e. to persist) across community types but is rarely applied beyond pairs of competing species. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by mapping species according to their niche () and fitness differences (). This application provides three main benefits to study processes of multispecies persistence across trophic levels. First, mapping introduces a novel categorization of species and communities according to the high-level processes at play: frequency dependence (negative or positive), the occurrence of positive species interactions (facilitation and mutualism) and whether persistence is possible without the presence of other species because of trophic interactions, such as herbivory or predation. Therefore, this mapping can be seen as a toolbox to describe how species persistence depends on species interactions. Second, mapping facilitates studying how species persistence responds to environmental changes that shift intrinsic growth rates and the strength and sign of species interactions. Third, mapping has the potential to foster synthesis across community types because it can accommodate co-occurrence of positive, negative and neutral interactions between species. We, therefore, argue that mapping can promote collaboration across sub-fields, as it provides a common concept to link disparate ecological communities.},

Recent research has shown that artificial light at night may not only affect the behaviour of animals but also growth of plants and vegetation composition.

Here, we tested how naturalized alien plants respond to artificial light at night, and particularly whether widely naturalized species differ from less-widely naturalized species in their response to artificial light at night. We grew nine taxonomically related pairs of widely naturalized and less-widely naturalized species alone and in competition, with native plants with and without artificial light at night. We found that in the competition treatment, artificial light at night significantly increased the total biomass production per pot, but not the biomass ratio between the naturalized alien plants and the native competitors.

  abstract = {Replication is widely adopted in modern Internet applications and distributed systems to improve the reliability and performance. Though maintaining the strong consistency among replicas can guarantee the correctness of application behaviors, however, it will affect the application performance at the same time because there is a well-known trade-off between consistency and performance. Many real-world applications favoring performance often choose to enforce weak consistency. Although there has been some work on flexible configuration of consistency, most focuses on design or deployment time. As the system settings constantly change during runtime, the tuning of the consistency-performance trade-off needs to be handled dynamically. Failing to do that will cause either underestimation or overestimation of the consistency and performance that can be achieved. Existing work does not well support the dynamic tuning of the aforementioned trade-off in runtime, which is mainly because of the lack of an appropriate quantitative model of consistency and performance. In this work, based on our previous effort on the quantitative model of consistency and latency, we design a replication protocol, CC-Paxos, to achieve an adaptive trade-off between consistency and performance according to application preferences and runtime information. By design, CC-Paxos is not bound to any specific underlying data stores. We have implemented CC-Paxos and applied it to MySQL databases. And real experiments both within a data center and across data centers show that CC-Paxos not only can dynamically adjust the delivered consistency in return for ensured performance but also outperforms MySQL Cluster in the case of strong consistency guarantee.

  abstract = {Crown architecture and leaf traits were investigated in understory saplings (17\textendash 233 cm tall) of Macaranga semiglobosa in a tropical montane forest in Indonesia. The crown of a M. semiglobosa sapling consists of only leaves without branches. The total number of leaves per sapling increased from 4 to 19 leaves with an increase in trunk height in the examined saplings. Leaf area index (total sapling leaf area divided by crown projection area) increased with trunk height because of the increase in the total number of leaves per sapling with trunk height. Thus, it is suggested that there is limitation to avoid self-shading. Leaf blade width was relatively constant from the top (the youngest leaf, leaf order 1) to the lowest (the oldest leaf) leaf. By contrast, petiole length increased from leaf order 1 to leaf order 6, and then remained relatively constant after leaf order 6. Vertical changes in the leaf mass per area within a crown showed a similar pattern to that of petiole length. Leaf nitrogen (a proxy of assimilation capacity) and chlorophyll (a proxy of light-harvesting ability) contents per leaf area increased from leaf order 1 to leaf order 4, remained high until leaf order 7, and then decreased after leaf order 7. The present study suggests that petioles of M. semiglobosa elongate for longer than the leaf blades and that leaf morphological and physiological traits are coupled with the degree of petiole elongation occurring with vertical position, and this might increase light-capture and nitrogen-use efficiencies.},

Recently, an increasing number of studies have tested the effects of productivity, disturbance, or ecosystem size on food-chain length in a variety of natural systems. Here we conduct a formal meta-analysis to summarize findings from these empirical studies. We found significant positive mean effects of productivity and ecosystem size but no significant mean effect of disturbance on food-chain length. The strength of mean effect sizes was not significantly different between productivity and ecosystem size. These results lend general support to previous theories predicting the effect of productivity and ecosystem size, but fail to support the prediction that disturbance shortens food chains. In addition, our meta-analysis found that the effect sizes of primary studies were significantly heterogeneous for ecosystem size and disturbance, but not for productivity. This pattern might reflect that ecosystem size and disturbance can affect food-chain length through multiple different mechanisms, while productivity influences food-chain length in a simple manner through energy limitation.},

  abstract = {Climate warming is one of the key driving forces of biodiversity loss. Yet, our understanding of underlying factors that link warming-biodiversity relationships at both local and regional spatial scales is limited. Here, I review how warming could change local-scale diversity of invertebrate animals. Specifically, I examine whether warming-prey diversity relationships are modulated by changes in predation at higher temperatures. I first review the predictions of bioenergetic models, and then carry out a systematic literature search to find empirical studies that have experimentally tested warming-prey diversity relationships together with warming-predation relationships as well as predation-prey diversity relationships both on land and in water. Empirical studies showed that warming consistently altered predation rates by either increasing or decreasing them. However, warming-prey diversity and predation-prey diversity relationships were inconsistent both on land and in water. Theoretical predictions of positive effects of warming on diversity in resource-rich environments were rarely tested by empirical studies. I suggest that warming-prey diversity and predation-prey diversity relationships can be better understood by incorporating three features of prey species: a) thermal tolerance, b) defense against predation, and c) ability to capture resources in warmer environments. I finally discuss the application of a prey trait-based conceptual framework to predict biodiversity changes from local to regional spatial scales in a warmer world.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the storage and spatial distribution of soil nitrogen (N) in China based on a data set of 2480 soil profiles and a map of Chinese soil types at a spatial resolution of 1:1,000,000. Our estimate indicates that the total N storage in China is 8.29 \texttimes{} 1015 g, representing 5.9\textendash 8.7\% of the total global N storage. The total N storage in China is on average or slightly above the average of its share in the global N storage, even though low nitrogen content soils cover a large area in China. N density varies substantially with soil types and regions. Peat soils in the southeast of Tibet, southwest China, show the highest averaged N density with a value of 7314.9 g/m3 among all soil types. This is more than 30 times of the lowest N density of brown desert soils in the western desert and arid region. The highest N storages among all the soil types are the felty soil in southeast of Tibet, dark-brown earths in northeast China, and red earths in southeast China with values of 921.1, 611.4, and 569.6 Tg, respectively. N density also varies with land cover types in China. Wetlands in southwest China exhibit the highest N density at 6775.9 g/m3 and deserts in northwest China have the least at 447.5 g/m3. Our analysis also indicates that land cover types are poor predictors of N content. Further research is needed to examine how transformation from organic agriculture to increased use of fertilizers and pesticides has influenced N storage in China.},

They are thus ideally suited for analyzing the complex dynamical models encountered in systems biology, where knowledge of the full (approximate) posterior is often essential.This talk gives an overview of an ABC algorithm based on Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC SMC). Different uses of the algorithm will be presented, depending on the application question of interest. The first is the general parameter estimation framework, where the interest lies in estimating the posterior parameter distribution from available experimental data. In the second context we ask whether the model can reproduce a desired qualitative or semi-quantitative behavior, and what dynamic behaviors the system can achieve. The third context discussed here for use of the ABC SMC algorithm is that of model selection. Here we ask which of the models (i.e. model topologies) from a pool of proposed candidate models represents the most suitable hypothesis about the biological system of interest.The focus of the presentation is applications of ABC SMC to questions from systems biology. ABC SMC is applied to a variety of biological models, including stochastic and deterministic descriptions of eukaryotic signaling pathways and prokaryotic stress response pathways. In particular, the algorithm is employed to understand understand the qualitative behavior of the phage shock protein response in bacteria Escherichia coli, and the model selection algorithm is applied to distinguish between differential equation models of MAP kinase phosphorylation dynamics and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.},

  abstract = {In both plant and animal systems, size can determine whether an individual survives and grows under different environmental conditions. However, it is unclear whether and when size-dependent responses to exogenous environmental fluctuations affect population dynamics. Size-by-environment interactions create pathways for environmental fluctuations to influence population dynamics by allowing for negative covariation between sizes within vital rates (e.g. small and large individuals have negatively covarying survival rates) and/or size-dependent variability in a vital rate (e.g. survival of large individuals varies less than small individuals through time). Whether these phenomena affect population dynamics depends on how they are mediated by elasticities (they must affect the sizes and vital rates that matter) and their projected impacts will depend on model functional form (the impact of reduced variance depends on the relationship between the environment and vital rate). We demonstrate these ideas with an analysis of fifteen species from five semiarid plant communities. We find that size-by-environment interactions are common but do not impact long-term population dynamics. Size-by-environment interactions may yet be important for other species. Our approach can be applied to species in other ecosystems to determine if and how size-by-environment interactions allow them to cope with, or exploit, fluctuating environments.},

For most of these examples, the posterior distributions are known, and so we can compare the estimated posteriors derived from ABC to the true posteriors and verify that the algorithms recover the true posteriors accurately. We also consider a popular simulation-based model of recognition memory (REM) for which the true posteriors are unknown.

Although difficulty in calculating a model's likelihood is extremely common, current ABC methods suffer from two problems that have largely prevented their mainstream adoption: long computation time and an inability to scale beyond a few parameters. We introduce differential evolution as a computationally efficient genetic algorithm for proposal generation in our ABC sampler. We show how using this method allows our new ABC algorithm, called ABCDE, to obtain accurate posterior estimates in fewer iterations than kernel-based ABC algorithms and to scale to high-dimensional parameter spaces that have proven difficult for current ABC methods.},

  abstract = {Describing how resource consumption rates depend on resource density, conventionally termed ``functional responses,'' is crucial to understanding the population dynamics of trophically interacting organisms. Yet, accurately determining the functional response for any given pair of predator and prey remains a challenge. Moreover, functional responses are potentially complex surfaces in multidimensional space, where resource density is only one of several factors determining consumption rates. We explored how three sources of error can be addressed in the design and statistical analysis of functional response experiments: ill-chosen spacing of prey densities, heteroscedastic variance in consumption rates, and non-independence of parameters of the function describing prey consumption in relation to prey density and additional environmental factors. We generated extensive, virtual data sets that simulated feeding experiments in which both prey density and environmental temperature were varied, and for which the true, deterministic functional response surface was known and realistic variance had been added. We compared eight different methods of functional response fitting, one of which stood out as best performing. We subsequently tested several conclusions from the simulation study against experimental data of zooplankton feeding on algae across a broad range of temperatures. We summarize our main findings in three best practice guidelines for the experimental estimation of functional response surfaces, of which the second is the most important: (1) space prey densities logarithmically, starting from very low densities; (2) log-transform prey consumption data prior to fitting; and (3) fit a multivariate functional response surface to all data (including all prey densities and other factors, in our case temperature) in a single step. We also observed that functional response surfaces were fitted more accurately and precisely than their component parameters. The latter occurred because parameter estimates were non-independent, which is an inevitable feature of fitting complex nonlinear functions to data: A given response surface can often be described with near-equal accuracy by multiple parameter combinations. We therefore conclude that fitted functional response models perform better at optimizing the fit of the overall response surface than at determining how component parameters, such as the attack rate or handling time, depend on environmental factors such as temperature.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a multi-objective mixedinteger linear programming (MILP) optimization model aimed at finding optimal resource allocation based on the study of an aircraft line maintenance. Some research had already been done to develop such model, but they mainly focus only on finding the optimal allocation based on man-hour needs without considering the related-cost, such as different hiring cost. Assignment of the workforce is presumably highlighted only in respective skills or task with no consideration of least hiring cost. Most research also considers only one resource in the model, which commonly is the workforce. This study proposes a resource allocation model in an aircraft line maintenance, which involves not only the workforce but also the material and tools. In this paper, we also accommodate the relationship between stations in terms of the possibility of resource transfers amongst them. The model is solved using the IBM\textregistered{} ILOG\textregistered CPLEX software. The result shows that the proposed model can be used to find an optimal resource allocation and the minimum total cost.},

  abstract = {An important aim of plant ecology is to identify leading dimensions of ecological variation among species and to understand the basis for them. Dimensions that can readily be measured would be especially useful, because they might offer a path towards improved worldwide synthesis across the thousands of field experiments and ecophysiological studies that use just a few species each. Four dimensions are reviewed here. The leaf mass per area-leaf lifespan (LMA-LL) dimension expresses slow turnover of plant parts (at high LMA and long LL), long nutrient residence times, and slow response to favorable growth conditions. The seed mass-seed output (SM-SO) dimension is an important predictor of dispersal to establishment opportunities (seed output) and of establishment success in the face of hazards (seed mass). The LMA-LL and SM-SO dimensions are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible tradeoff, and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf size-twig size (LS-TS) spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size are poorly understood. The height dimension has universally been seen as ecologically important and included in ecological strategy schemes. Nevertheless, height includes several tradeoffs and adaptive elements, which ideally should be treated separately. Each of these four dimensions varies at the scales of climate zones and of site types within landscapes. This variation can be interpreted as adaptation to the physical environment. Each dimension also varies widely among coexisting species. Most likely this within-site variation arises because the ecological opportunities for each species depend strongly on which other species are present, in other words, because the set of species at a site is a stable mixture of strategies.},

Using a two-resource competition model, we studied the evolution of resource-uptake specialisation as a function of resource type (substitutable to essential) and shape of the trade-off between resource uptake affinities (generalist- to specialist-favouring). In spatially homogeneous environments, evolutionarily stable coexistence of consumers is only possible for sufficiently substitutable resources and specialist-favouring trade-offs. Remarkably, these same conditions yield comparatively low diversity in heterogeneous environments, because they promote sympatric evolution of two opposite resource specialists that, together, monopolise the two resources everywhere. Consumer diversity is instead maximised for intermediate trade-offs and clearly substitutable or clearly essential resources, where evolved metacommunities are characterised by contrasting selection regimes. Taken together, our results present new insights into resource-competition-mediated evolutionarily stable diversity in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments, which should be applicable to a wide range of systems.},

In a descriptive sense, the term "light pollution" refers to the effects of any poorly implemented lighting, during the day or night. Light pollution can be understood not only as a phenomenon resulting from a specific source or kind of pollution, but also as a contributor to the wider, collective impact of various sources of pollution.Although this type of pollution can exist throughout the day, its effects are magnified during the night with the contrast of darkness. It has been estimated that 83 percent of the world's people live under light-polluted skies and that 23 percent of the world's land area is affected by skyglow. The area affected by artificial illumination continues to increase. A major side-effect of urbanization, light pollution is blamed for compromising health, disrupting ecosystems, and spoiling aesthetic environments. Solutions to light pollution are often easy steps like adjusting light fixtures or using more appropriate lightbulbs. However, because it is a human-made phenomenon, addressing its impacts on humans and the wider ecological systems of Earth involves vast societal complexities that overlay light pollution with political, social, and economic considerations.},

Species on dry and infertile soils converge towards higher LMA. It has been generally assumed that this allows species from low-resource habitats to achieve longer average leaf life spans, as LMA and LL are often correlated. 2 Leaf life span and LMA were measured for 75 perennial species from eastern Australia. Species were sampled from nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites within high and low rainfall regions. LL and LMA were positively correlated across species within each site. In addition, evolutionary divergences in LL and LMA were correlated within each site, indicating that cross-species relationships were not simply driven by differences between higher taxonomic groups. 3 Within a rainfall zone, LL\textendash LMA combinations shifted as expected along common axes of variation such that species on poorer soils had higher LMA and longer LL, but significantly so only at high rainfall. 4 Low rainfall species were expected to have shorter LL at a given LMA or, equally, require higher LMA to achieve a given LL, i.e. shift to a parallel axis of variation, and this was observed on both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils. On average, 30\% higher LMA was seemingly required at dry sites to achieve a given LL. Thus, convergence towards higher LMA has different consequences for leaf life span in dry and nutrient-poor habitats. 5 The broad shifts in LL\textendash LMA combinations between site types were also seen when comparing closely related species-pairs (phylogenetically independent contrasts) occurring on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils (within each rainfall zone), and at high- and low-rainfall sites (at each soil nutrient level).},

  abstract = {1 Most plants withdraw nutrients from leaves as they age, and redeploy them elsewhere in the plant. The proportion of nutrients resorbed and the residual nutrient concentration in senesced leaves are different but complementary indices of nutrient conservation via this process. A major spectrum of strategic variation runs from plant species with typically long leaf lifespan (LL), high leaf mass per area (LMA), low leaf nutrient concentrations, and low photosynthetic capacity, to species with the opposite characteristics. It is unknown to what extent either facet of resorption covaries with the LL\textendash LMA spectrum. 2 Green-leaf and senesced-leaf N and P concentrations were quantified for 73 evergreen species from four sites in eastern Australia (nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites in each of two rainfall zones). Leaf nutrient concentrations in green and senesced leaves were negatively correlated with LL across all species and at most sites, especially if N2-fixing species were excluded from analyses involving leaf N. 3 Proportional resorption did not differ with soil nutrients, as has been found elsewhere, nor was it correlated with LL. Green-leaf and senesced-leaf nutrient concentrations were lower for species on poorer soils. A simple model was described in which the proportion of resorbed vs soil-derived nutrients deployed in new leaves is set by the relative cost of nutrients from the two sources. The model provides a prospective explanation for the observed differences between species from nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor habitats. 4 The results from this study provide support for the argument that selection to minimize nutrient losses has affected the residual nutrient concentration in senesced leaves, rather than proportional resorption per se. Further, variation among species in residual nutrient concentration was correlated with one of the key spectra of strategic variation between plant species, the leaf lifespan\textendash LMA axis of variation.},

  abstract = {I present a meta-analysis of plant responses to 48 nutrient addition experiments conducted with native species in naturally growing tropical forests, exclusive of mangrove forests. The added nutrients include nitrogen (N) in 36 experiments, phosphorus (P) in 33 experiments, calcium and potassium in one experiment each, and various mixtures of essential nutrients in the remaining experiments. I evaluate the hypotheses that nutrients limit tropical forest plants, nutrient limitation is stronger in successional than in old-growth forests, P but not N is limiting in lowland forests, and N is limiting in montane forests. Responses to the most complete nutrient mix used in each experiment were strong for plant functions that contribute to aboveground production (Hedges' g averages 0.87) and nonsignificant for fine root biomass. Responses to N addition and to P addition were strong for tissue concentrations of the added element (Hedges' g averages 0.75 and 1.4, respectively), moderate for fine litter production (0.64 and 0.65, respectively), moderate to weak for plant growth (0.46 and 0.37, respectively) and nonsignificant for fine root biomass. Growth responses were stronger in successional than in old-growth forests. All responses were unrelated to elevation. The 48 experiments included 30 factorial nitrogen-phosphorus experiments that enable additional direct tests of the widely cited hypotheses that P limitation is stronger than N limitation in lowland forests and vice versa in montane forests. Both hypotheses were rejected. The N \texttimes{} P interaction effect was nonsignificant across the factorial experiments. In conclusion, nutrients clearly limit tropical forest plants. Limitation by N is widespread in both lowland and montane forests, and the same is true for P. Single experiments identify limitation by calcium and potassium, and correlative studies suggest limitation by calcium, potassium, and magnesium. The available evidence is consistent with the possibility that most macronutrients limit tropical forest plants; however, experiments focus almost exclusively on N and P. The way forward will include taking fuller advantage of existing nutrient addition experiments, siting new experiments strategically, and developing cost-effective methods to assay responses to all of the essential nutrients soils supply to plants.},

  abstract = {Gaining a better comprehension of the growth of microorganisms is a major scientific challenge, which has often been approached from a resource allocation perspective. Simple mathematical self-replicator models based on resource allocation principles have been surprisingly effective in accounting for experimental observations of the growth of microorganisms. Previous work, using a three-variable resource allocation model, predicted an optimal resource allocation scheme for the adaptation of microbial cells to a sudden nutrient change in the environment. We here propose an extended version of this model considering also proteins responsible for basic housekeeping functions, and we study their impact on predicted optimal strategies for resource allocation following changes in the environment. A full dynamical analysis of the system shows there is a single globally attractive equilibrium, which can be related to steady-state growth conditions of bacteria observed in experiments. We then explore the optimal allocation strategies using optimization and optimal control theory. We show that the solutions to this dynamical problem have a complicated structure that includes a second-order singular arc given in feedback form and characterized by (i) Fuller's phenomenon and (ii) the turnpike effect, producing a very particular asymptotic behavior towards the solution of the static optimization problem. Our work thus provides a generalized perspective on the analysis of microbial growth by means of simple self-replicator models.},

  abstract = {Understanding evolutionary forces that maintain sexual reproduction has been a central question in evolutionary biology, because the well-known ``two-fold'' cost of sex demands an explanation, especially since asexual reproduction (vegetative reproduction and parthenogenesis) often arises by mutation and hybridization. Geographic parthenogenesis, where asexual reproduction by close relatives of sexual lineages tends to be found in ``marginal'' habitats, has been considered a key pattern for studying the maintenance of sex. Recent studies of sexually reproducing populations have revealed that mating attempts by males can be harmful to females due to sexual conflict. Where that occurs and where there is a mixture of both sexual and asexual females, if male mating harassment is more harmful to asexual females than to sexual females, this may prevent the invasion of rare asexuals. Here, we use a simple ecological model with density-dependent male mating harassment to show how asexual reproduction can become prevalent in habitats when environmental conditions are poor (i.e., low carrying capacities). The maintenance of sex is possible in a bistable system where abundant males are so harmful that they prevent the invasion of rare asexuals. However, male density is not large enough to suppress asexuals and sex is lost when carrying capacities are low or when sex ratio is highly male-biased. While previous theoretical studies employed a frequency-dependent model to study male mating harassment, we demonstrate that density-dependence may be important to explain the dynamics in low population densities where there is geographical parthenogenesis.},

Here we identify a previously unrecognised mode by which rapid evolution can promote species coexistence via temporal fluctuations and a trade-off between competitive ability and the speed of adaptive evolution. We show that this interaction between rapid evolution and temporal fluctuations not only increases the range of coexistence conditions under a gleaner-opportunist trade-off (i.e. low minimum resource requirement [R*] vs. high maximum growth rate) but also yields stable coexistence in the absence of a classical gleaner-opportunist trade-off. Given the propensity for both oscillatory dynamics and different rates of adaptation between species (including rapid evolution and phenotypic plasticity) in the real world, we argue that this expansion of fluctuation-dependent coexistence theory provides an important overlooked solution to the so-called `paradox of the plankton'.},

We assessed how differences in plant tissue N content, soil nutrients, N cycling rates, microbial biomass and activity, and diversity and abundance of N-cycling microbes associated with these species impact their competitiveness. Mikania micrantha outcompeted both native species by transferring more N to plant tissue (37.9\textendash 55.8\% more than natives). We found total soil N to be at lowest, and available N highest, in M. micrantha rhizospheres, suggesting higher N cycling rates compared with both natives. Higher microbial biomass and enzyme activities in M. micrantha rhizospheres confirmed this, being positively correlated with soil N mineralization rates and available N. Mikania micrantha rhizospheres harbored highly diverse N-cycling microbes, including N-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Structural equation models indicated that M. micrantha obtained available N via AOA-mediated nitrification mainly. Field data mirrored our experimental findings. Nitrogen availability is elevated under M. micrantha invasion through enrichment of microbes that participate in N cycling, in turn increasing available N for plant growth, facilitating high interspecific competition.},

  abstract = {The tree growth and mortality trade-off is well documented and plays a key role in forests by forming the basis of many ecosystem processes and contributing to tree species coexistence. One area that requires further understanding is how the growth-mortality trade-off is influenced by biotic and abiotic interactions in the forest. In this study, we used a 5-year interval of tree growth and mortality demographic data from a 9-ha forest dynamics plot in a temperate old-growth Chinese forest to address two questions, (1) What is the nature of the growthmortality trade-off among species in this forest? (2) Are there differences between the responses of tree growth and mortality to local neighborhood variables, both biotic and abiotic? Specifically, do these responses vary among species and with tree size? For the first question, we hypothesized that, within species, mortality rate would be negatively correlated with growth rate, whereas among species it would be positively correlated. For the second question, we expected biotic and abiotic factors to both be important for tree mortality; but expected biotic factors to be more important than abiotic factors for tree growth. The responses of tree growth and mortality to local neighborhood variables, both biotic and abiotic, varied among species. Abiotic factors were more important than biotic factors for small trees; biotic variables were stable with tree size for both small and large trees. Our results showed that there were differences between the responses of tree growth and mortality to local neighborhood variables (i.e., biotic and abiotic) in this temperate forest community. The responses of tree mortality to local neighborhood variables strongly varied across species. Abiotic factors were only important for the growth of small trees. Biotic factors were stable with tree size for growth of small and large trees, but not for mortality. Mortality was negatively correlated with growth for large trees within species; growth-mortality trade-off among species was found to be more accentuated for small trees. The responses of tree mortality to local neighborhood variables differed strongly across species, whereas the responses of tree growth to local neighborhood variables varied among size classes. Tree growth and mortality is tightly correlated both within (negatively) and among species (positively), and their relationships are both size dependent in this temperate forest. Our findings highlight that differential responses of tree growth and mortality to local neighborhood variables continue to shape the forest community well after sapling establishment in this temperate forest community.},

  abstract = {Species coexistence in diverse communities likely results from multiple interacting factors. Mechanisms such as conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and varying life-history strategies related to resource partitioning are known to influence plant fitness, and thereby community composition and diversity. However, we have little understanding of how these mechanisms interact and how they vary across life stages. Here, we document the interaction between CNDD and life-history strategy, based on growth-mortality trade-offs, from seedling to adult tree for 47 species in a tropical forest. Species' life-history strategies remained consistent across stages: fast-growing species had higher mortality than slow-growing species at all stages. In contrast, mean CNDD was strongest at early life stages (i.e. seedling, sapling). Fast-growing species tended to suffer greater CNDD than slow-growing species at several, but not all life stages. Overall, our results demonstrate that coexistence mechanisms interact across multiple life stages to shape diverse tree communities.},
